their biggest cricket stadium as we pick up the t20 series the first of three news from the middle sri lanka have won the toss they can have a ball first the two teams lots of changes a few new faces in both teams sri lanka handing out two debuts one to charitas and charming the other india handing out two caps as well to crippy shaw and baron beautifully bowled beautifully bald they struck early they have first ball pretty sure goes what a lovely delivery that was [Applause] it swings late and the line was such that pritisho had to play at it jamiro strikes pretty sure without scoring not for one india [Applause] boundary a boundary to end the second 12 for one shot great shot wonderful from sanji [Applause] sampson [Music] [Applause] that's four more four more [Applause] is it carried has it carried he loves the catch they're gonna have a little look upstairs they're gonna have a little look upstairs let's have a look for the soft signal which the umpires reckon is a no let's have a listen oh what do you make of that what do you make of that the soft signal is no i'm gonna go with knot out i think that bounces just before his fingers but he saved his team four that was racing away i think the right decision right now the skipper in the company of sanjay samson going along well that's the first big hit and that's massive straight behind the baller and well beyond the side screen as well picking it early not an easy bowler to come down to akilah the ninja [Applause] delivery well done indeed sanju samson dead as a duck strikes of the very first delivery he bowls india 51 for two sanju samson goes for 27. ripped away in the gap and that's four [Applause] short and that had to be put away in the gap and sodium [Applause] but dealt with very clever indeed [Applause] got it has he got it you bet he has all the way what a shot against the spin this time captain shaker darwin chancing his arms there you go knocked each other but still went through it first six in three innings the mystery spinner aquila is coming under pressure it's gone for 35 and he hasn't completed three [Applause] and that should be four as well that's beautifully struck too much flight for the said batsman [Applause] swept away he's found the gap he's found the gap and he's hit it well enough that's not a good sight let's hope it's a passing shower chance in the deep chance in the deep oh nearly misjudged it as well [Applause] has he got enough he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't have enough he's gone another soldier by champ this time sheikha down finds that lone fielder at deep squaligashin bandara it's a good running catch the most important wicket for the sri lankan the two better stealing batsman going there a wicket on debut flicked away there's a man in the deep he has to make up a little bit to his right that holds on to it and yes you should celebrate the first of many maybe for karuna ratner the captain played well shika darwin he played well but in the end he goes for 46 indian r1 13 for three got it he's got this one yes yes that's a biggie he's looked to go this side of the ground fairly often it's the shorter side again slower ball this time he's picked it and he knows there's plenty of space square of the wicket crucial over hasaranga starts off well surya kumar yadav that's this half century 33 balls he's a special player just look at that able to hit it on the up hit it straight hit it clean should be taken will be taken he has the last laugh plays with a lot of heart that's exactly what he is telling everyone this clever bowling deceives a man on fire sure mariada cannot believe what he's just done will that go for four that's speeding away yes it does so ishan kishan into the act oh that's one heart should go all the way six runs to ishan kishan [Applause] kishan is deep inside the crease though slightly but what works in his favor is the extra pace that offered him on that occasion that's been swung away is that sweet or dropped [Applause] didn't hang on it's a long boundary there very long boundary [Applause] one big one for chamira he's been very very good 10 off 12 india 153 for five that's been swung away but not powerful enough for it to find the boundary so just one of the last ball of the 20th over just nine of that over so this has been good finishing from sri lanka as india get to 164. they're the first t20 international here at the r premadasa and that's what sri lanka need 165 of their allotted 20 overs to take this first t20 international vervenet sure kumar has a slip for abhishek shaw woman on the other side of the circle two inside the circle on the leg oh as soon as he shows not tall enough to grab that four of the very first delivery but it could have been a wicket oh very well played got well inside the line got plenty of bat on it first ball four for me now showing his level of confidence up and oh burst through the hands i think that's hardly fun there there he catches that every single day of the week except today is that edged yes given by the empire but he'll go upstairs now i do think that's 50 50 could have struck perhaps uh the thai guardian roll forward roll forward flat line flat line when the ball passed the bet very happy to overturn his decision that was off the pipeline up in the air again this time taken come on not very smartly done by me note lucky to get away earlier this one straight to surya yadav no protection on the offside no one on the boundary so minnows looking to clear that area minot goes for 10. sri lanka 23 for one cut oh and again i think uh surya yadav got his fingertips to that and it was struck so hard straight behind the bowler very full easy pickings avishka's in good form another boundary over mid-on easy calculated and a boundary cleaned him up what a delivery he got a wicket of the first delivery in the first odi second delivery the ninja silva's inning comes to a close [Applause] what a wonderful experience delivery yeah absolute braille trimmer goes for nine sri lanka 48 for two swung away and it's gone straight into the hands of prithvi a shot sanju samson not what sri lanka wanted the said batsman taking the lone field that deep squalic sanju samson didn't have to meet an inch [Music] that sounded good and that's gone the distance welcome to the crease panda what a shot by charity look at that what a great shot young man down leg unfortunately doesn't get a boundary for that [Applause] has he done enough now let me show a little late with that dive oh that struck very well now with that go all the way and just over the boundary line about a yard or so now if you're needing to take a chance it's got to be from here charitasalanka targeting the lakeside up in the air nobody there clever shot a couple bounces for a boundary oh got him while he have a slightly slower delivery it's been hard work for pandara in the middle it's not often that you'd say but sometimes you feel a wicked could be what you need that's even as a batting unit 9 off 19 for shinbandara it's 90 for four hit hard again is that gonna go all the way and once again it just lose the man at the deep wind wicked boundary well struck indeed by a slunker shorter boundary that's where i'll go nice nice great option goes big again finds the gap this has been very good from the left-hander got it has he got it no he doesn't he doesn't that's a big big wicket for india the four man is gone just didn't quite get enough of it on the boundary sure down a deep midwicket takes the catch comfortable comfortable catch yes sir i got india one shahar's got one getting out in a crucial moment for sri lanka got it gone for 44 26. 111 [Applause] he'll probably walk to the wicket now because that's the end of hassaranga second ball the stumps have been disturbed good stuff very good led by deepak chahar inside out missing all ends up outside edge bit unlucky got to be said but saying that beautiful left it was a brief stay zero one one one for six that's gone oh yes please that'll help a lot keep the shape it is what a good shot by nathan shanaka this should get him going not going to miss out on that opportunity bisecting that long on leave me to get boundary for a six [Applause] a little inside edge an inside edge and karuna ratna is gone good time to go hard vice captain of the indian cricket team [Music] has to depart for three minutes successful man 122 [Music] and go upstairs it's a smart bit of work by shane kishan okay take it back take it back slow slow okay roll forward okay satisfied you know back foot captain making his way off the ground already the back foot raised and ishan kishan quick as a flash takes the bales off goes for 16 in trouble now 124 for eight this will be up this should be out and it's simple catch on the long arm boundary the last rights are being read here for sri lanka nine down off the bottom of the bat easy simple catch surya kumar and long on almost done for indians actually like a nine down one two five out the ground oh out out that's it that's it india have won the first t20 international here in colombo good catch by kunal pandey and

just run away from you down there at these short straight boundaries [Applause] overworked that'll do nicely thank you very much it's a good first over for new zealand 12 coming from it is like all young fast bowlers oh that's what he does that's what gupta will do to that ball that's just short of the length circle and then a very backward point as well they're unlikely to have a man station there [Applause] 25 without loss i'm going to come out swinging oh so close and this should go for four as well so luck is favoring the brave right now behind square maybe gonna bowl a bit shorter no he's gonna toss it up and he's gonna get smashed over his head for six and a big one at that oh chipped it chipped it just went for four we hardly hit it now that is control that comes out the fingers differently it just took three it just took a few locks before gupta decided to climb into it and therefore the short ball doesn't work either oh he went up he went full again and he paid the price the line was different but it's just as good a result for gupta real dynamo lives and maher in the world knows that stoinis crunch one bounce for nearly six this is a start and a half beautiful oh they'll run away as well what new zealand have done tonight tarpon striker well as they've hit gats they've timed it beautifully paula monroe is looking over wide midwicket here about there and it's found it quite nicely looking and delivered that length doesn't work so well see that happening all the time oh that's lucky could run away good chase but chrislyn bails out he's had some injury problems that might have been a good goes the timing there very very good 20 rows back half a chance there you missed it 107 oh that's massive a huge strike up into the deep midwicket region and capital has 50. now monroe gets it too and monroe has 50. unbelievably good this from new zealand's point of view that could have been brilliant get your hands around that can't just carries on richardson down on the boundary wasn't that far from him early on but you get that i have capitalized oh here's another fireworks are going over the screen into the crowd a [Applause] just standing it's air time not down yet world angel tithing i don't believe it surely not surely this didn't go all the way what did it got them there in the first place it's a length ball she's going to be plenty more all the way eleven always wanted this fantastic crowd tonight just a tickle it gets to the boundary in a flash well this is how simon dole and the bulldog said that new zealanders would [Applause] straight to the field of deep square makes no mistake this is where you've got to get players trying to hit it to the longest boundaries the length there's nobody there only the camera crew 14 i don't think enough bowlers go to the yorker soon enough well that's just got an extraordinary shot it's gone up in the air i thought this will be four more perfectly placed he is on fire tonight down the ground again mid on comes in he's already said he's six more yeah this is what drives stay 88 from 47. that is massive that is just so high goodness me it certainly went higher than it went longer it's still over six trademark from gotzel not looking once he's hit it keeps the head down so far up in the air glenn maxwell even though it only went about five or six meters 94 [Applause] [Applause] has his second t200 on his backyard outstanding knock martin gupta dangerous player clean hitting of the qriket ball to all parts of the ground just checking that last one but was signaled by the field in the deep but hit the boundary on the full which is six confirmed there and hit firmly oh very clever very nifty the confidence of youth good stuff 206 for two 16 gone 44 runs conceded in two and a half overs now then this could be out should be out there's out this time maxwell gets it right and guptor's magnificent knock here at eden park comes to an end they are on their feet and so they should be good response from the crowd even the australians are getting in congratulating what was a magnificent performance from martin guptill the low full toss was the delivery that brought him undone pretty close to that waist high as well maxwell in the deep very safe hands and the end of a great knock [Applause] yeah an economy rate wise ashton agar has been the best of the australian bowlers wow that's out that's gone skiing in the most unfortunate way mark chapman has to leave the ground he's had his helmet knocked off his head back onto the stumps so billy stanley does have a save this is a dismissal you don't see very often quite a nasty one it would have been a nasty blow to the head without the helmet but uh how often do you see that and that decided to give it a go out of the old days oh that's dragged on as well beautifully bold took all the pace out of it and a few hiccups coming at the end yes inside edge this could be out as well yeah comfortably taken ty in the date again and pace is pulled back and again williamson can't find the timing yeah you're right one eighteen white smithy again is it over the top it is yes that is the late momentum and that is 50k is it i think it is got to get it in the zone tyre you've got to get it in the zone it's there taylor gets it and gets it for six to finish how appropriate is that some vic hitting from shall we say the senior man and new zealand are going to finish tonight at 243 for six and to be fair this crowd of 30 000 plus have hardly sat down through the whole 20 overs simply amazing stuff as well [Music] over the top yes it is chipped but timed from david warner 11 without loss after one [Music] two with 50 grand cats on edge go all the way as well deep over that's ridiculous [Music] it's a thick outside inside edge more luck everyone's a winner hot chocolate [Music] cricket it's earned his way into this australian side this time oh my goodness me oh you feel you feel for the bowlers surely but he's a cracking butt this is a new one thick inside edge stick outside four i was just looking to see it both of those boundary fielders out on the left down diving away tim seifert pick up four always a chance is this it's in the air a long time gets that one gets it behind square picks up four and more 16 from that over australia off to a flyer 43 without loss oh another one another inside edge might not pick up four this time so so he stopped but no he can't just kept running away from him we were just saying darcy shaw swung away will it go all the way yes it will yes it will you betcha where's mitchell is he out there high in the air and long way over long on as well another six for david warnup great striking too short too short four more adam to the extras bumble gotta get together new zealand getting away australia well he's going to have to do something because this is just becoming a riot here five men inside the circle on the off side saudi gets hit straight for six just a chip just the chip that's extraordinary let that guy's fuse now then that is massive again huge top deck west stand no doubt there six anywhere 91. that has hit so hard so hard tour delivery and australia have a hundred already [Music] david warner has 50 off just 20 balls and he isn't finished yet through the middle has been new zealand's weapon that's a bad delivery and it costs it again just being pressured into bowling mistakes [Applause] [Applause] that's the wicked new zealand needed and it was the google david warner going on the back foot to try and hit it away to the onside and misses it completely maybe just a lack of pace off the surface and straight through the end of a fine innings from the skipper 24 for one now that's is up and over and it didn't look to be that well timed solely down the ground this will test it on and off and they get nowhere near it went like a tracer bullet i know you used to be crowds but what do you think of the atmosphere here oh look it's absolutely amazing you know you talk to a few of the rugby union boys that play here all the time there's a look at that dave unfortunately what we'll do is we'll head upstairs but we'll see all the very best thanks man that takes it as martin gupta yeah look he blows the raspberry out there almost death like in the approach there this time he goes land and he gets smashed for the onside oh it's as easy and as simple as you like look out in hospitality it's coming your way i just hardly missed the blockhole but that's all it takes today another one high into the stance see he's trying to vote full and straight or full but he's missing goes short again that's risky really risky yeah and it's four more 162 for two string of wickets when no one could find the middle of the fence his wheeler and there goes wheeler it's not wheeler's night i was just going to say ben wheeler coming back for his third over having another guy and again over the offside this is in the gap too does it go all the way not quite he's come back he's pulled two balls here wheel to play the little little scoop shot now he goes short the slower ball and that is some brilliant batting that is some outstanding play well just clear thought but the task at hand that they should be tremendously confident and that helps that was just a long hot though and he just picked the spot and smashed it punched down the ground dead straight yes another boundary they are making a mockery of this quill they got him maybe a bit of bottom edge involved max was furious with himself it was on for him to close the deal as he did the other night not tonight though oh that's too high i think yeah it's been called no ball so there's going to be a free hit that is the worst possible result from new zealand's point of view oh this got away as well the bowlers get the yips uh yeah we do we do hurricanes apologize to all hurricanes fans straight up tim seifert be the man you are so using bolt has worked is there a late charge coming that is huge for new zealand bolt's the man beautiful shot wouldn't that be a ball but the way he worked it down the fine leg was superb so that's a huge australia not possible not now maybe one of the most eventful overs you'll ever see has finally come to an end 25 for one it produced absolutely chocolate sedan park sunday night [Applause] beautifully done against the angle coming into him that is superb and very clever goodness me how big is that and that is that as they say that is that the catch that means absolutely nothing to that bloke except he should hold on to the ball and put in his pocket but the fact of the matter is this that massive hit from aaron finch has put a full stop on a world record run chase by australia and can you believe

catch it's off the turf is Paul sterling was gone wonderful piece of that elitism and it's very best floating more and more here and now the Knights of 21 for six when Knights are having a horror sure here I just knew what he had to offer both on and off the field as a good how hard is it to Don things around for it for your team you know when their first game yeah look we lost horribly but the end of the day it's just one game in the tournament and it's important that we still remain positive and with clear minds they don't need a coach jumping down the 27 for the loss of six that's a high full toss [Music] close to a hundred I can't with that put an air hostess on it it's over the roof [Applause] he's a strong striker airborne add some serious air miles on it yeah he loved it as well just a shimmy and off [Music] do 130 I was talking about it was who runs away outside edge and I won't chase it down there's some good fortune that's the 50-50 for six you know they have got the old rounders in you you always want to have your one of your regular batsmen out there throughout the 10 overs if you want to really sleep oh yeah that's a good strike please got all of that he's got the big blind and a big hit you for a six every time you bought that Blin this was a quicker delivery easy for him to just get under it and swing that back bliss always going another one that's gone for six back-to-back six [Applause] just gonna have a look and see if it goes it sit on the floor does it seeks it's two in a row this isn't it away Oh is he going out of it I think he has just it's a big iover 23 from it so it's exactly what they need a trio bits remaining then out 69 4-6 the Pepsi catch an eight-course Saturday you'll see a lot of people coming especially in the evening when the lights are on mixed up cutting out of the keeper and another week it'll fall and that was headless ran and the non-striker did not want to go wonder whether he was ball watching yeah I think he was just looking at the ball and looking at if the field is gonna miss it or not and did not hear the fall from the striker the news easy runs a big opportunity to finish it off and needle a lot of these players playing this format nicely played good deft touch flick all the way then we gotta catch the one that's going into the crowd and she kept so it looks like they're gonna surpass that it'll look like it for a while don't handle Parnell it's a little flick using the pace beautifully and it went a long way oh yeah well that's smart that's what you're talking about that's the slow ball again and moved on its way and danced away because it deserves a good dancing yeah very even final ball that's a good shot that is a really good shot that's like Shahzad yesterday [Music] and now they're 92 for seven moaning there it goes that'll be a boundary 98 they're close to a hundred what a recovery this has been by the Knights has changed and they've changed it with their lower order to bear delivery from Cuddy yeah he's looking for that your coat but yeah what a wonderful look come back you know thanks too piggish score having been five to twelve well yes well played and what a finish the Knights have recovered 103 for seven yeah that was 59 for one being in the mine the sevens we could fill 70 100 3 4 7 and look 23 from 14 and the partnerships down the bottom got them there then we're in Parnell first and bowling was superb there's a matter hog-eye me get yourself in the game in the field first ball you've got a tight Cyndi's versus Kerala nights live from Sharjah cricket stadium bill hanging in there and then Wayne Parnell with a brilliant in instance lutely is it like him I I think he's an unusual style play hits in areas that are not common and therefore he's finding gaps often as the wicked till we could just leaked four runs right who have we got Tom Curran coming on to ball yeah and he was expensive yesterday so he's got to try and find the ocean it's a smash and six be easily done by depth which he was quite expensive in particular one of his overs yesterday because of the lengthy bowls and if you've got the leverage and that ability that Dipsy chairs as most of these batsmen do it's just a natural strike it's another head down the ground couple of bounces and into the fence we talked for fours and sixes well the reason I say I think they play Tambe smartly is I think because he's such a wise campaigner and he can't get him away too often he's almost the guy were you trying not overs and then you start to look at the damage at the other guys Karen went for the thirty from his two overs yesterday and the first one went for twenty-one and straightaway look at this Rama's picked up by deficits he made it look so easy I Randy yeah just stayed where he was and use the pace and ball boy they're taking a very good catch yeah there's acreage of open area that you just think of last night after the game Karen would have been thinking right what did I do wrong that over that went for 2009 play the shots or such a glorious straight drive from Shane Watson 25 from the over it's a massive overhaul the Cyndi's 29 without a wicked tea without a wicked in 2.2 well that's how you play a t10 you've got to go for it and you take a band or any which way through the legs French cat as they say in fact behind that back leg dip stitches on strike glares the front leg and hits it sweetly into the gap what a good shot down at a time with even though it's Cpl and he's a lovely chap as well talks it simply talks himself down he said I've just to slaughter I just get out there I just don't swing the bat that's gone that's lap four six pick the wrong on and hit it across the line against us bend dips it there's magnificent tonight and how much uh can you be thinking about the wrong end of the left hand like he got the stumping yesterday that it was the length covers the thumbs and well Paul are there is so good with these caches the one hand me over steps and then the free hit it's smash for six surge ask it's over the rope but all the same it is cost plenty cost plenty now they moved to fifty seven hits it hard why not shot that is he's brilliant he's brilliant and he has to be an opener they got it wrong in the West Indies he has to bat at the top you think if it's t20 he's got six overs a pair play where it blow there he goes slicing it past the feeling for for Shane Watson because it turned out to be a no ball it's been downhill ever since that moment for North a free hit went for six deficits then took a liking and hit him hard four fours and then no i oh that's a half it that do very nicely for Shane Watson it's a big six absolutely brilliant with that straight shot well that's what I love about him he keeps it simple that's wise so consistent because it goes down the ground oh that's a big one that's done the distance and how almost hits the roof he I he loved it as well made a great sound if it got from here on in the air someone's gonna catch that it's comfortable it's did such that has to go cheeky little googly from lemak Charney yeah wanted to go big didn't get all of it that's gonna stone with useful numbers mind if it was down the line that's down the line that's over the line over the line Watson's not gonna miss our this swell set now is playing really well that's his third six off the inning is he gone with the ah that's even better it's a little flick such control here from Watson well fancy catch a crook very similar action replay stroke this one he timed it even better those in the crowd nobody giving it giving it a try to catch that maybe it did got a hand now let's just go on the other side now sees Shane Watson been through the onside time to go through they're loving it well that's a convincing win then good thing B is on he battered well in the last game the pause level very comfortable victory in the end and rightly so to the cinders and the Camden sees it all the way through with a half century little reading care we go over these red outfits Shane Watson marvelous performance after that deficits played extremely well and the captain himself the skipper Shane Watson got this is this date belongs to the bowlers we have seen a couple of head tricks and end table ever Tommy was outstanding picking up but not only five acres but major Ricketts the the veteran

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WR7l8gi2SA&t=8s,-WR7l8gi2SA&t," we are at the green park here in Kanpur we've been here many times as players before but today it feels a little special because this is now the venue for the 500 Test match for Indian cricket which is quite an achievement Ravi Shastri is here with me just four nations have managed to play 500 Test matches that's a large number and Indian cricket should be really proud of this fact absolutely because it's a long journey started in 1932 so you know you know they played all these years they've sustained the interest of the people you know Test matches were hard to come by you know in the early years but you know what's what we are seeing today is fabulous you know and we are at a heritage ground this is one of the oldest grounds in Indian cricket when India had its first original when you scan pool was one of them yes so you know it's it's amazing how history just writes his own script India played its first Test match in 1932 the hundredth Test match Mansur Ali Khan patottie was the captain happened in 1967 35 long years to play their first hundred Test matches and and again tribute there you know to the Board of Control for Cricket in India to sustain the interest you know to invite teams from overseas invite the right teams you know it would cost money you know they would want retainers they would want bank guarantees in advance but by calling those teams like the West Indies the Australians you know when New Zealand when they were strong you sustained the interest of the public you know and what you did was ensured that the Indian team got good competition and became stronger decade by decade we are talking Test match forget but you a part of that 1983 World Cup winning squad the response the reaction there was a lot of adulation fanfare but not too many financial rewards I mean that is a big change when India wins now there's also financial rewards with it no but that was the one single moment you know that redefine the way people looked at cricket in this country as a sport you know parents wanted young kids to play the game your corporate houses came behind backing the sport like never before you know the sudden interest or the just the way the cricketer was looked at by the armed junta by the the corporate crowd you know by the blue collar was totally different and India started playing well you know they they enjoyed that attention they got you know they the performance is short you won the World Championship after that you know you again staged the World Cup in India where we lost in the semi-finals but you had a sequence of good performances you know which when television came into India exploded and that's why today like I said to you earlier it's a small scale industry you mentioned it's a billion dollars porneia yeah it's a fact it's a billion dollar small scale industry is settled it yeah so much has change over the years you were being part of this whole chain this long journey as a player as a broadcaster you've also had held responsible positions within the cricket team as well if you look at Indian cricket say maybe in the 70s 80s and now 2016 what is the big change you see with the brand of cricket that India is played I think fabulous it's like I say they're the back Piper's of world cricket wherever they go you get huge audiences and obviously that has to reflect on some of the great players who played in that time you know the fact that they've handed on the baton to a good young generation who play attractive cricket and let's not forget you know it's evolved the game has evolved perfectly from India's point of view you know you have Test cricket then you have 50 over cricket and then you have twenty20 instant cricket you know which I think the game needs all three formats you know Test cricket will benefit because if the money that's made out of 50 over cricket and 2000 cricket is channeled back into the system at grassroot level you keep having a strong test team for your stew I'm glad you brought that topic on because this is not just about raving about Indian cricket this is also a time when you of course there's a cause for celebration 500 test magic this match is a big deal so you celebrate that landmark but there's also a matter of concern with regards to Test match cricket some efforts are being made to make Test cricket viable bringing the audience's people at home as well you know the that number can go bigger how do you think that that can happen and is it possible at all with the changing tastes of the modern audience it is possible if there is good competition you know if there's good competition it is very possible also I think you don't need to tweak it because luckily cricket has three formats you know you have games like football baseball they haven't changed barring one or two rules nothing has changed in over 100 years so you don't want to tweak it too much to confuse the common man you have three formats so leave Test cricket as it is for God's sake leave the ball the same red color only reason why that is being attempted Ravi's to ensure that you play at a time when people are not working yeah because when they are at work it's not possible even if they like Test match cricket to watch it and I think that is the reason why they are doing it Tampa by all means but you know I would rather have a session under that's the point you made earlier a session under light maybe three hours under lights which means you start not little late it start at 1:00 o'clock or 12:30 make sure the game gets over by 8:00 8:30 so people can go back home but the different thing you give them you don't have to change anything too much you know both sides know they will have to back one session with a red ball and the lights wickets might fall runs might be scored anything can happen but the rules stay for both sides it's how you adjust adjust ended up as long as it's not dangerous I don't think it's dangerous with lights here today and that could suddenly start getting in more people you know attractor you know make it more attractive for the television audience so as well you know these are the things you want to try and think but without trying to tweak it too much now these obviously are long-term challenges that I'm sure the world cricket is aware of it they look at this as one of the goals to achieve the challenge for Indian cricket and the BCCI is what's happening in the courts the court orders the low-doc Commission their recommendations so it's a it's a huge deal Indian cricketer you know have to tackle a lot of these recommendations which they find are unfair and might stifle the growth of Indian cricket some feel that Indian cricket will not be able to stand on its feet if all these recommendations were put into place what are your views on that see I didn't get a chance to speak to the loader committee right but they are X Supreme Court judges and they have got experience you know so obviously they've gone through a lot of stuff they've spoken to a lot of people and come up with a lot of recommendations now when it comes to governance when it comes to administration you know where if they felt that things weren't going well they've got every right to mention what can be done the same with governance another brief that they had been given was to sort out the fixing problem you know how do you sort it you know there has to be it cannot be a bill has to be passed it you know you should know what has to be done where a guy is punished in such a fashion that it deters other players from doing it it which means a recommendation to Parliament to pass a bill you know which can put a guy in the clink so that no one else will want to do it again fine but there are certain areas we know where I thought that you can still have a dialogue with the loader committee because those are things if applied it could take the game back it will be tend to become like for example the cooling-off period yeah okay why would I want to join the bc's here why would any player want to join the BCC if I have an idea that is something constructive that I can do contribute in three years you're telling me to go but what can anyone achieve in three years he gets to come back but the cooling cooling off although I know the guy and after me is competent enough if I have done a competent job I should be respected for my competency and where I think six years is no harm after that if you have to sit out for three years come back for another six fair enough but six years is enough time even the presidential candidate of the country it's a five-year term hmm you know unless something happens and there's an election in between he stays for five years you know and that's anywhere in the world yeah any other recommendation that you're eating I thought the selectors that you know three when I played the game I thought three selectors was enough but today the way the game has evolved with the three formats of the game the interest that exists in the country the combined number of people that play the game in India is more than the population of all the countries that play cricket together so if Australia has three selector that's fine it's 20 million people 17 million people here you have 1.2 billion I mean you're asking that poor guy too much you know he'll get serious travel miles yeah you know if he is one of the three will go from one end to the other of the country and still not be able to do a job I think five is still in order and another thing you know I've always believed there's no substitute for experience hmm you know we say that in cricket this is something I've learned from the sport it's something I've learned when I've interacted with people from different you know different fields in life whether its corporate whether it's sport whether its administration you name it and I certainly believe in what I am saying there's no substitute for experience and we've got a couple of guys in the board you know they're 70 plus but they'll forget a youngster they'll give anyone from any field a run for their money you know I'm not targeting anyone or anything because I've I've seen them work yep I've seen them as administrations I don't to single out or take names I've seen them working people know who I'm talking about because I don't mince words in any way but they are outstanding so you know and these things if you try and push it immediately it might just be detrimental at this moment of time so if you have to make a final sort of assessment and roundup of the load ah recommend your dialogue but still continue you know for all of you think it's a bit under it shouldn't be like a boxing bout I think there has to be some you know where genuine effort should be made you know ideally from both parties to have a dialogue on certain things which you know can work most of the recommendations are anywhere accepted and the board is trying to do something but you know this this tree cooling period is harsh and also if you want cricketers to come into the system spell out this is a professional job look wicked I will want to do a non read job yeah it's a professional job you know you you played cricket for six hours in your time you know at times when you see what people get today you got peanuts you know but then if you pay peanuts you get monkeys so get get professional professional will write the right number on the money what should be given for this job that job whatever comes their way make it professional you see a lot of cricketers coming into the system well thank you so much Rabia for talking really passionately about this it's a very sensitive topic but I've been very amazing I'm passionate Sanjay is because it's a great cricket playing country it is and if things were that bad you won't have achieved what you have achieved we're celebrating five hundred Test match you won two World Cups you're number one team in the world so all cannot be wrong yes there might have been areas which you know you needed a whack on the backside to be corrected you know but could that be the reason why some feel it's a bit extreme I won't say extreme dialogue I'm saying dialogue you know a dialogue because let's be practical if it can work or not work you know because we want Indian cricket to carry on we don't want it to go back five years you don't want this team to suffer five years you'll have they'll be total chaos other teams get the upper hand and then again you have to try and climb up the ladder dividing to be fair let's say let's get back to what is really important which is you know cricket on the field and as I said 500 tests might on this venue it said okay we've all been tests we get fans it's the ultimate test for a cricketer 500 Test match we are celebrating that today thousand Test match for India possible or you'll test cricket my struggle to read the or it can happen as easily as the last sort of 300 matches have happened see I'll tell you you know it's again personalities I believe who make the sport we had one gentleman yesterday who played 40 percent yeah okay inspire generation after generation when he played the game and there were another little fellow before him exactly and before that the spinner see every era has superstars but when you have someone like a Tendulkar who played across two and a half generations and where everyone in this team literally worships you know suddenly from this team if you get an individual you know barracks already outstanding you get two three more individuals who carry on that the good job that was done by the players earlier exactly what Kapil Dev said the other day and he's a legend the law is to take a number of people caps you know really write inspired so that will make people ten years down the line twenty years down the line wanting to play Test match cricket and twenty years down the line no be whole you might be 1,000 and 1,200 you're talking about peanuts you pay peanuts you get monkeys maybe Test match cricket

certain threats certain sororities you know among certain friends yet the people we idolize are most are the ones that stand out but when you're prepared there is no fear there is no fear of failure because even if you've walked out of something and you feel like you failed at it your preparation is so strong that you're gonna take that failure and turn it into the outcome you desire and most people stop at failure okay we've all failed at things i'm going to continue to fail at stuff right it's the most powerful tool you can use but it all depends on how you use it what would your future be like if you decided to to want that which you desire so strongly that it prepares you past your fears that you experience the fear as the one book says feel the fear and do it anyway life is 10 percent what happens to you it's 90 what you do about it no matter who you are no matter where you are in life you can take the lid off of your jaw and and if if you're wondering if you still have the lid on in your life here are some clues that's going to let you know that the lid is still on if you're not excited about waking up in the morning if you're sitting around bored out of your mind if you got time to do everything anybody asks you to do you probably got the lid on if when you tell your dreams to all your friends it makes sense to them you got your lead on man your dreams should be should not make sense to everybody you got to say something to make people go how you going to do that that's when you got the lid off and if i were you i'd do that i take the lid off makes sense to me they're always going to get ready to get set to get going what we've got to do is boom just like that move into action every time you remember your dream you're removing some dirt you're digging it back out the true mark of a champion is even though some dirt gets thrown on your dream instead of letting it get buried you keep shaking it off you keep moving forward you keep looking for a new opportunity you wouldn't be having that opposition if you didn't have something great in you if your dream wasn't alive and on track right on schedule to come to pass you wouldn't have so many things coming against you that dream is still alive you may have tried a year ago five years ago or 40 years ago didn't work out nobody was there to help you go back and try again this is your time this is your moment your destiny is calling out to you can i tell you your dream is not dead it's just not in season your time is coming promotion is coming good breaks are coming promises you've been standing on dreams you've been praying about lack is not your destiny constantly struggling barely getting by is not the end of your story these light afflictions are for a moment the adversity is temporary the glory is eternal [Music] lord i believe this is my year to get healthy and hope this is my year to meet the people of my dreams this is my year to go further in my career to step into a new level of my destiny this is my year to accomplish dreams to break free from this depression this is my year to meet the right people this is my year to get healthy and whole this is your year to see double this is your year for vindication for restoration for new beginnings now get your mind going in the right direction here's the secret the people that do the most with their lives the people that seem the most self-assured the ones that seem to embody confidence the ones that seem to define confidence they're the ones that had to face down the most fear they simply didn't linger in it don't hate your competitors respect your competitors learn from him i had a very important person my life come to me and say who's your hero and i said i don't know i gotta think about that give me a couple of weeks i said i thought about it you know who it is i said it's me in 10 years so i turned 25 10 years later that same person comes being though so are you a hero and i was like not even close she said why is it because my hero is me at 35 so you see every day every week every month and every year in my life my hero's always 10 years away i'm never going to be a hero i'm not going to obtain that i know i'm not that's just fine with me because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chase that's the thing success and failure are generally slow processes either slowly building things up or gradually tearing them down and that's why i say you've got to pay attention you have to watch you have to watch every single second choose love and don't ever let fear turn you against your playful heart i believe in manifestation i believe in putting a rocket of desire out into the universe and and you get it when you believe it you get it when you believe you have it and that's the key so we want to get really sensitized acutely sensitized sensory acuity to whether what we're doing is working or not and by the way sensory acuity is really the measure of a person's intelligence what i mean by that is how do we measure intelligence intelligence is a measure of the number and quality of distinctions you have in a given situation you can handle this you just haven't figured it out yet it's all right this is your training period this is the tuition you have to pay for what you don't know you can do this other people have done it doesn't take an einstein get you some people that can teach you some stuff that you don't know get you some people that have done it successfully and learn from them take some seminars workshops read some books on how to manage a business change the way you see yourself and begin to tend to the personal details understand that nobody's going to take care of your business better than you you will notice the most successful people in any field they are usually the ones who have failed more than anybody else you see the difference between a successful person and everyone else it's not a lack of strength it's not a lack of knowledge it's a lack of will [Music] you must experience what this life is totally isn't it before you go you must experience this if you do experience that then such questions will never arise in your mind because that's not the way existing things [Music] it's up to you in a world where we're taught to look outside for answers for a job that will make us happy for money that will make us happy that answer is within we already have it we already have the answer but will we unleash it will we give it will we own it will we truly reinvent ourselves to become the people that were capable of becoming the bow too tightly strung as easily broken says one of the problems balance is a gorgeous thing so be monomaniacal in your execution around your high value targets your hvts your mission plan but also build in some rewards and that's going to send a gorgeous message to your conscious and your subconscious mind that hey this daily practice of execution around my deliverables is a beautiful thing and you create this thing called momentum and the monk who sold his ferrari i went back and i saw this recently i think there's a whole chapter on momentum and you become like this i love skiing you start off small but as you go down the slope you pick up momentum a lot of people say robin where do i start i want to start a new business i want to become a better artist i want to find the love of my life i want to be a world-class creative i want to multiply my financial life where do i start you just start you just start there's great power in the start and when you start life starts supporting well god wants us all to be courageous because he knows we'll face times in life and situations and circumstances that it takes more than just the desire takes courage [Music] many people operate on the basis of fear on the basis of what other people think we as believers should operate on the basis of courage courage to say no and we ought to say no courage to say yes when we should say yes so what kind of courage do you have is your sort of floating between depending on the situation or do you know the difference between right and wrong for your life and you've made up your mind you,"["" A wise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuw8hxrFBH8,Tuw8hxrFBH8, today i want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories [Music] the first story is about connecting the dots [Music] i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months or so before i really quit so why'd i drop out it started before i was born biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and seventeen years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldn't see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasn't all romantic i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example reed college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but 10 years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards 10 years later again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i loved to do early in life woz and i started apple in my parents garage when i was 20. we worked hard and in 10 years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned 30 and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at 30 i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didn't know what to do for a few months i felt that i'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit i'd been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the likeness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apple's current renaissance and laureen and i have a wonderful family together i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick don't lose faith i'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle my third story is about death when i was 17 i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years i've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important tool i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it's life's change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish,"["" i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for

that's great we're up-to-date you know you but your brain is the only thing you have when you're going through depression when you're going through hard times you're going through death real life you can't Google that man you're alone you're alone you may have a shrink you're going to you may have a best friend you going to but there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone in this brain and your brain is talking to you in all kind of ways and it wants to control you and pull you in these different pockets if you can't control your own brain and your brain controls you you're you got to tell your brain where you want to go and how you want to go and how you want to get there you got to control it if not it's over but existed for me was okay man how am I gonna make this work and all I knew back then was hard work the only way anything gets accomplished that's all I heard back in those days you got to work hard you got to work hard I'm not getting how did I can't get this paragraph I can't remember what this paragraph to pass this test to get the military breathe again I'm still not getting it read again but it's not getting it write it out and now I started learning okay well I can't I gotta write out everything I do and then write it out again and write it out again and guess what happened I got it I got it I can't swim I'm negative buoyant go back again I can't swim go back again go back again go back again I got it I realize if I keep going back and going back and going back until this just becomes your mind was safe okay we're gonna figure it out because he is not going to stop it's like I'm gonna try one more time no I'm gonna it's just like long clock goes off Boop we're going back I can't read right we're going back I gave myself no way out and my mind realized that they said okay we're gonna adapt and overcome now like a lot of people say trying hard they your mind knows man it knows this guy's bull guys lying there's no truth behind it when I was a Navy SEAL training people oh how are you there for 18 months the program is always six months long you were in three hell weeks in one year no one's ever done that how did you do that I talked about the new norm when I lived in the $7 a month place and I was growing up for a short period of time I loved it I don't know you know any different that was my norm once we move down that place we moved to $236 month place I was like I never want to go back to that little pieces but if you go back to that seven dollar month place and you realize this is where I live that's all I got your mind says Roger that this is home so when I was going to Navy SEAL training for 18 months and going back through all the hard part's over and over again I told myself after the first time I knew this could be a long journey there my body was breaking down it was it was just how it was going on I see know what this is my new normal so my mind said is that going to work like you go to work you put your suit I on I'm going to suffering every day every day suffering being broken duct taping my feet up stress fracture shin splints being broken this is my new norm and your mind says if we're not broken just say normal we got to be broken so then your mind starts to get tougher and tougher and more cast people huh how did you run on broken feet broken broken shins my mind knew this is how we operate we're a Navy SEAL training this is what we are I health and that became my new norm I gave myself no way out there was nothing outside these walls of hell nothing I became I love God but for a short period of time I became the devil because that was hell I became I became the boss the owner the CEO of Navy SEAL training that was my mindset and that's how you get through things you put yourself you immerse yourself wherever it is you become that you become that and give yourself nowhere yeah when I was tours in 97 pounds and I was fat as hell trying to be a Navy SEAL the scariest thing in the world to me even to this day was that that could have been the rest of my life I thought then I was trying hard that's the scariest thing in the world I thought then two or 97-pound working for Ecolab's spraying for cockroaches making $1,000 a month I thought that was me at my 100% potential come to find out a few years later I wasn't even near that 106 pounds less graduating Navy SEAL training we don't do all these other things looking back on that that was me trying hard that's why people got understand what is in us we have no idea until we start trying hard and I mean really trying hard where you're obsessed with hey this is my new norm my new norm is that wow this isn't always fun it's not always meant to be fun and that's when you know you're trying hard people hear my story and think this guy's sadistic I realize how the how the brain works I figured out how the brain works I'm a scared kid and that's what gives me so much power I had no foundation and I built this off of just researching the mind the feeling you get is basically invincibility you realize that you can't do it all the time when you need to do it I know I can go to a place that I can live in and when you know that you can run on broken legs and you can do certain things that a lot of people can do but they're not willing to do this power this sympathetic nervous system of fight or flight and you're fighting it gives you this charge of energy over when you're sitting there at 3:30 4:00 o'clock in the morning and you're duct taping your feet up because they're broken and you're doing it by yourself and you're going to do arguably one of the hardest training in the world and these guys most of them are healthy and you're going through it broken and you already at a disadvantage but you're still there you can feed into that and tap into that for a lot of power but if you look at it while I'm broken man like I'm not gonna make it if you look at it as man I'm broken and I'm still here and I'm fighting and I'm gonna find a way to get through this because I have no other place to go it gives you a lot of power when things start to suck really really bad my brain and a lot of people's brain DUP they don't go to your dad beating you up your brain says win it right here this is miserable so anger goes away a lot of times when you're suffering because your brain that says we got a run we got to go so that anger is not popping up saying oh I'm gonna show them I want to show those people no there has to be a much deeper if I say deeper it has to be down to mineral mineral soil it has to be down to that nice mineral soil where nothing can burn you can't burn dirt so it has to be down that low that literally is submenu that's at the core your soul and but you but you don't find it unless you spend a lot of time with what you want to be in life you I can't give that to you right you can't give it to somebody when when you find your true passion in life and my passion for me when like I want to be now given my Navy SEALs I mean roundish I want to serve my country I cared about I want to be someone that I'm proud of I want to look at myself in American I was so disappointed that accountability man I talked about I was so disappointed in what I saw every day I want everybody to love David Goggins and a lot of people did I didn't love myself but I knew a lot of us want to find peace first so gonna say man you always talk about this suffering and pain --is-- I'm at peace right now because I'm going to do that you don't find peace first if you do Merry Christmas more power to you more power to you I found peace on the opposite end of finding myself and no one really finds himself without going through trials tribulations suffering accountability and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBSeCp__xhI,eBSeCp__xhI," Today, I need you to embrace what comes hard to day I need you to accept the challenge  Today I need you to fall in love with the process  There will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged,  to lose your passion  and think that it's not meant to be. But if you're going to reach your destiny,  you have to have a made-up mind. If you give up after the first time  or the fifth time or the 30th time,  what that really means is you didn't want it bad enough. There should be something you're believing for that you are relentless. You are not moved by how impossible it looks,  you're not discouraged by how long it's taking,  you don't give up because people told you no, you're attitude is,  ""If I have to believe my whole life,  I am not going to stop believing,  I am not going to take no for an answer,  I'm not going to settle for mediocrity,  I'm going to keep pursuing   what put in my heart."" and ask ourself, ""What do I really want?"" What do I really want? And write it down. Writing causes thinking, thinking creates an image and you get these images  And you get this images growing,  your building a vision in your mind. It's the visionaries. That's changed the world. Think of that. But what keeps that competitive edge What keeps you on top is the ability to think  and prepare mentally over and over and over again. The body has limitations. The mind does not. We focus so much  on what goes on the neck down that we forget it all starts from here. Everything starts from there If you're not mentally ready,  you're never really physically prepared. And that's where the preparation starts. What would your life be like?  As you look toward the future, if you decided I'm not going to allow my fears to stop me. And I'm saying to you, whatever you gotta do, Do it. Because if your don't life is gonna whoop you until you surrender. So when you're young and you make mistakes, don't let 'em eat you up, 'cause everybody that done made it done made 'em. You got to fail in order to win. Hey, look, man. To understand how to hit the game when it's shot, you got to miss the game when it's shot. You know, you got to be tough because  the road to success is always under construction. It's never a clear path to success. The people who become successful are the people who have a relentless attitude. And you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks, 'cause the bad breaks is comin', but they usually come right before the big break is about to happen. You get a series of bad breaks and it stumbles up a lot of people. My life and my success is to say to anyone, ""You can stumble, you can fall, you can get back up again.""","["" There will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged,  to lose your passion  and think that it's not meant to be .

small in settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living now i'm sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life i'm sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on make sure you got something to fall back on honey but i never understood that concept having something to fall back on if i'm going to fall i don't want to fall back on anything i want to fall forward i figure at least this way i'll see what i'm going to hit without consistency you'll never finish so do what you feel passionate about passionate about take chances don't be afraid to fail there's an old iq test was nine dots and you had to draw five lines with a pencil within these nine dots without lifting the pencil the only way to do it was to go outside the box don't be afraid to think outside the box don't be afraid to fail big to dream big but remember dreams without goals are just dreams reggie jackson struck out 2600 times in his career the most in the history of baseball but you don't hear about the strikeouts people remember the home runs [Music] fall forward thomas edison conducted 1 000 failed experiments did you know that i didn't know that because the one thousand and first was the light bulb [Music] fall forward every failed experiment is one step closer to success got to take risks and i'm sure you've probably heard that before but i want to talk to you about why that's so important you will fail at some point in your life it you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something there's no doubt about it and i know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony but hey i'm telling you embrace it because it's inevitable in the acting business you fail all the time early on in my career i auditioned for a part in a broadway musical perfect role for me i thought except for the fact that i can't sing i didn't get the job but here's the thing i didn't quit [Music] i didn't fall back i walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition i prayed i prayed and i prayed but i continued to fail and fail and fail but it didn't matter because you know what there's an old saying you hang around the barber shop long enough sooner or later you're gonna get a haircut so you will catch a break and i did catch a break [Music] last year i did a play called fences on broadway but here's the kicker it was at the court theater it was at the same theater that i failed that first audition 30 years prior the point is every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed but do you have the guts to fail if you don't fail you're not even trying [Music] i'll say it again if you don't fail you're not even trying to get something you never had you have to do something you never did imagine you're on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of the ideas you never acted on the ghost of the talents you didn't use and they're standing around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together so i ask you today [Music] how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes [Music] i just got back from south africa it's a beautiful country but there are places there with terrible private poverty that need help and africa is just the tip of the iceberg the middle east needs your help japan needs your help alabama needs your help tennessee needs your help louisiana needs your help philadelphia needs your help the world needs a lot and we need it from you we really do we need it from you young people i mean i'm not speaking for the rest of us up here but i know i'm getting a little grayer we need it from you the young people because remember this you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got whether it's your time your your your talent your prayers or your treasures what are you going to do with what you have i'm not talking about how much you have some of you are business majors some of you are theologians nurses sociologists some of you have money some of you have patience some of you have kindness some of you have loved some of you have the gift of long-suffering whatever it is whatever your gift is what are you going to do with what you have all right now here's my last point about failure sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going your life will never be a straight path i began at fordham university as a pre-med student i took a course called the [Music] cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it i couldn't say it i surely couldn't pass it so then i decided to go into pre-law then journalism and with no academic focus my grades took off in their own direction i was a 1.8 gpa and the university very politely suggested that it might be better to take some time off i was 20 years old i was at my lowest point and then one day and i remember the exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my mother in her beauty shop my mother owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon and there's there was this older woman who was considered one of the elders in the town and i didn't know her personally but i was looking in the mirror and every time i looked in the mirror i could see her behind me and she was staring at me she just kept looking at me every time i looked at her she kept giving me these strange looks so she finally took the dryer off her head and said she said something i'll never forget she said young boy i have a prophecy a spiritual prophecy she said you are going to travel the world and speak to millions of people [Music] and in the years that follow just as that woman prophesies i have traveled the world and i have spoken to millions of people through my movies millions who up until this day couldn't see me who up till this day i couldn't see while i was talking to them and they couldn't see me they could only see the movie they couldn't see the real me [Music] but i see youth today [Music] and i'm encouraged by what i see i'm strengthened by what i see [Music] because taking risk is not just about going for a job it's also about knowing what you know and what you don't know it's about being open to people and to ideas the chances you take the people you meet the people you love the faith that you have that's what's going to define you never be discouraged never hold back give everything you got and when you fall throughout life remember this fall forward [Music] you,"["" i found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks nothing Nelson mandela said

because I was fat and people don't want to do that they want to say I don't call yourself fat don't call yourself dumb if you're not real and wrong with who the you are nothing's gonna change in this nice new world that we live in we want to hear you're just a little big no man you might be fat we surround ourselves around people that make us feel great they tell us what we want to hear the second we put ourselves amongst the uncommon people we don't like that feeling that challenge them filled that up of that person's brick about 330 boys hey push your [ __ ] off going for a run you like that person who says hey you know I mean I don't feel good today man and they say oh it's okay brother we don't want that mother there's like this hey man no bro get you [ __ ] on man stop being a punk [Music] it's all about the pretty mind so what's the pudding mind so let's say it's day one of a job interview we all know do it right yet the clothes laid out you got food ready to go in the morning you've been prepared for weeks and weeks and weeks you show up and you bring your best self job Christmas all right later you're ready your minds trumped everything New Year's comes up guess what don't have including mine repetition every day I believe that most human beings are only living at about 40% of their capabilities the mind has a government like a car if you're driving a car and the car has a governor on it the car may say hers at 30 miles an hour but the governor set 491 the car wants to go the car wants to go but that factory said ah we're not going to past 91 we have a factory a nice governor in our brain and it's a survival mechanism it protects us from pain and suffering at all times of your life the mind has attacked with banners of why is it it knows it's your friend it knows your insecurities it knows your deep dark lies and it starts to push you away from that it pushes you in a direction that is comfortable the mind controls everything you get to 40% your brain says we're done let's roll man this is trying to get painful this is uncomfortable so you sit down you have to figure out ways and everybody's different that's how the book kind of talks about like we all have these things about you know five steps to this and four steps to this it's it's a lot more than that that's all [ __ ] it's it's a practice that you have to it's a habit so if you know that 40 percent I'm still you know I'm feeling pain at 40 percent feeling pain that's where the forty percent rule kicks in now it starts okay I'm feeling pain my mind staying on the saying get out of here run flee the fight-or-flight kicks in okay we're gonna we're not good enough and starts telling you all these things you start to believe it because the mind controls all this is the time where you have to gain control back of your mind it's there okay let me see if I can go 45 and once you start giving yourself more and more hope instead of realizing okay the mind starts to be okay what you do we're supposed to be going right and you're going left you start then controlling your mind start finding more in your in yourself and it goes from 40 percents a lot closer than you that's the start of it go get to the spot where your mind is saying stop wherever that is gotta get there first and then that's when that starts to work you gotta control yourself in that moment what that time of year again we start to feel good happy quiet because we're not going to work if you believe in Santa Claus and you celebrate Christmas do it before the Santa Claus coming to Virginia eating some friends it's a real good time of year so in that good time of year due to barter still sucks was great to start making promises to ourselves about hey I'm gonna lose some weight how would you better to be better here to be better there but guess what happens the real Merry Christmas happens with all that noise it's gone was quiet and is you against you and now at all and uh punish me by getting up early and getting after to go lose weight study harder guess what it's locked farther now that repetition becomes a lot harder now and so lobbyists can't do things on the road so find somebody in your life so you throw that towel in they throw that one back at you and say you're not done yet how you gonna feel man if you accomplish this goal coming back come in from them in hell you came from a logical start from a good starting point at a good foundation what if you can surpass all of these everybody who was way up here started up here and you had you start with no legs he had a goat legs

more engaged and to be empowered is to move through the world without any kind of fear or any kind of apology and with these gifts comes an even deeper privilege i believe and that is the ability to take charge of your own life to own yourself and claim your rights and here's what i know for sure that to whom much is given much is expected and i have been given so much i've earned it i've been blessed with it but i've been given a lot and that's why i've chosen to use my life to lift other people up nobody's journey is seamless or smooth we all stumble we all have setbacks if things go wrong you hit a dead end as you will it's just life's way of saying time to change course so ask every failure this is what i do every failure every crisis every difficult time i say what is this here to teach me and as soon as you get the lesson you get to move on if you really get the lesson you pass and you don't have to repeat the class if you don't get the lesson it shows up wearing another pair of pants to give you some remedial work and what i found is that difficulties come when you don't pay attention to life's whisper because life always whispers to you first first and if you ignore the whisper sooner or later you'll get a scream whatever you resist persists but if you ask the right question not why is this happening but what is this here to teach me what is this here to teach me it puts you in the place and space to get the lesson you need my friend ed cartole uh who's written this wonderful book uh called a new earth that's all about letting the awareness of who you are stimulate everything that you do he puts it like this he says don't react against a bad situation merge with that situation instead and the solution will arise from the challenge because surrendering yourself doesn't mean giving up it means acting with responsibility i have a very big light and so people with big lives can do big things and so i started to think about what was the best christmas i ever had in my life i grew up poor on welfare with my mother for part of my life and i remember the best christmas of my life was when i was 12 years old and my mother had said we're not going to have christmas because we can't afford it i remember feeling like it's going to be really hard on christmas morning to go outside what am i going to do when everybody else is outside that's what i thought what am i going to do when everybody else is outside and what am i going to do when i have to go back to class and say i got nothing so that's what i was mostly worried about and then some nuns showed up some three nuns came to our house and they gave me a doll and they bought us food and we had our christmas that was the best christmas of my life because somebody remembered and i wasn't going to have to be the kid that said i got nothing so i wanted to be able to create that same feeling for children who had nothing so i decided to go to south africa originally i wanted to do a million kids and then just realized with i only had four weeks vacation so in four weeks i could not reach a million kids because i didn't want to just write a check send a donation i wanted to be able to look in each kid's face and say to that child somebody remembered you and so that's what i did with my life this christmas i took 41 people from here hired another 50 people over there and we were traveling caravan from one village to the next we did 2 000 kids a day we had parties for children who were orphans and it was singularly i will tell you i could weep thinking about it the singularly the best experience of my life the singularly best experience of my life the first day in africa where we had 280 kids in a room and every single one of those kids had lost a parent every single one of those children they were aged three to 17 in that room and my team that you're talking about i have the greatest team in the world my team in the here in the united states had been in contact with the orphanages so that by the time we got there we had a present with every child's name on it this summer every black doll manufacturer in the country had sent me dolls because i these girls had never seen black dolls and so it was my mission to do for them what the nuns had done for me was to let the african girls see a black doll so i wanted every girl to have a black doll i wanted every boy to have soccer balls we bought radios we bought clothes and the most important thing is we had their names on every box for every child and i called up the children one by one and when those children you know received their gifts and then waited for the next child to receive their gifts and said i said nobody can open their presents until everybody can open their presents and on the count of three when i counted the three and those children open their presents was the single greatest moment of my life i have a big life so i can take 50 000 presents and do that over and over and over again to orphanage effort orphanage but what i felt in that room for those from those kids is a lot of what you're talking about and what you're talking about and what you see in the faces of those women when you look into the eyes of someone and you give them a gift whether that be a physical gift or it be a gift from your spiritual self from your presence from the essence of you and you see the light you see the joy what i felt in that room was not just that i was remembered that the child felt that i was remembered but you felt a sense of hope a sense of validation a sense of validation that somebody cared about me and i will tell you that of all the years and shows that i have done and every theme for every show that i've done the single common dynamic denominator that i've found that every human being is looking for is validation every single person needs to know wants to feel that they matter that they matter and what happened in that room that was the greatest day of my life i knew that those children knew in that moment that they mattered that they mattered and so i encourage you it's exciting to be able to write a check it's even more exciting to be able to touch one life to be able to do that for one person it's like cynthia was saying when you can do that for one person when you can do that you will know that your life has meaning and i will tell you when i left that place my friend gail and i were there and we're all boohoo and we're like boom with the children oh my gosh and gail was saying what is it what is it we're so full as gail said to me she said you know as big as your show is as big as your show is what happened in that room seemed bigger what happened in that room sing bigger and that is true that is true for me who has this big life in a television show and i'm telling you for everybody here extending yourself beyond your world your kids your family your stuff and reaching out to somebody who is not like you somebody who is like you who is indeed if you are feeling depressed or you are feeling down or you're feeling like things aren't going the way you want them to go in your life the way you turn that around is to reach outside of yourself to somebody else reach outside of yourself to somebody else it will change you it will change you so it is my intention my intention to fulfill the dream of the creator it is my intention to live to the highest calling and be pressed to the mark of the highest calling that i have come to do and when you can ask the creator ask that which made you you what is your dream for me i guarantee you instead of you trying to define the dream what is your dream for me if you're able to lean into the dream that the universe and all the forces of of of of light and love and power and grace by all the names that we call god has for you nobody can touch you nobody can touch you [Music] so [Music] you,"["" Empowered is authority it is a sign permission slip to actually seize the day it's the
