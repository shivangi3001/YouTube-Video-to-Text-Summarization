            " [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow [Music] the attention of the qriketing world returns once again to the capital city of sri lanka colombo and to their biggest cricket stadium as we pick up the t20 series the first of three news from the middle sri lanka have won the toss they can have a ball first the two teams lots of changes a few new faces in both teams sri lanka handing out two debuts one to charitas and charming the other india handing out two caps as well to crippy shaw and baron beautifully bowled beautifully bald they struck early they have first ball pretty sure goes what a lovely delivery that was [Applause] it swings late and the line was such that pritisho had to play at it jamiro strikes pretty sure without scoring not for one india [Applause] boundary a boundary to end the second 12 for one shot great shot wonderful from sanji [Applause] sampson [Music] [Applause] that's four more four more [Applause] is it carried has it carried he loves the catch they're gonna have a little look upstairs they're gonna have a little look upstairs let's have a look for the soft signal which the umpires reckon is a no let's have a listen oh what do you make of that what do you make of that the soft signal is no i'm gonna go with knot out i think that bounces just before his fingers but he saved his team four that was racing away i think the right decision right now the skipper in the company of sanjay samson going along well that's the first big hit and that's massive straight behind the baller and well beyond the side screen as well picking it early not an easy bowler to come down to akilah the ninja [Applause] delivery well done indeed sanju samson dead as a duck strikes of the very first delivery he bowls india 51 for two sanju samson goes for 27. ripped away in the gap and that's four [Applause] short and that had to be put away in the gap and sodium [Applause] but dealt with very clever indeed [Applause] got it has he got it you bet he has all the way what a shot against the spin this time captain shaker darwin chancing his arms there you go knocked each other but still went through it first six in three innings the mystery spinner aquila is coming under pressure it's gone for 35 and he hasn't completed three [Applause] and that should be four as well that's beautifully struck too much flight for the said batsman [Applause] swept away he's found the gap he's found the gap and he's hit it well enough that's not a good sight let's hope it's a passing shower chance in the deep chance in the deep oh nearly misjudged it as well [Applause] has he got enough he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't have enough he's gone another soldier by champ this time sheikha down finds that lone fielder at deep squaligashin bandara it's a good running catch the most important wicket for the sri lankan the two better stealing batsman going there a wicket on debut flicked away there's a man in the deep he has to make up a little bit to his right that holds on to it and yes you should celebrate the first of many maybe for karuna ratner the captain played well shika darwin he played well but in the end he goes for 46 indian r1 13 for three got it he's got this one yes yes that's a biggie he's looked to go this side of the ground fairly often it's the shorter side again slower ball this time he's picked it and he knows there's plenty of space square of the wicket crucial over hasaranga starts off well surya kumar yadav that's this half century 33 balls he's a special player just look at that able to hit it on the up hit it straight hit it clean should be taken will be taken he has the last laugh plays with a lot of heart that's exactly what he is telling everyone this clever bowling deceives a man on fire sure mariada cannot believe what he's just done will that go for four that's speeding away yes it does so ishan kishan into the act oh that's one heart should go all the way six runs to ishan kishan [Applause] kishan is deep inside the crease though slightly but what works in his favor is the extra pace that offered him on that occasion that's been swung away is that sweet or dropped [Applause] didn't hang on it's a long boundary there very long boundary [Applause] one big one for chamira he's been very very good 10 off 12 india 153 for five that's been swung away but not powerful enough for it to find the boundary so just one of the last ball of the 20th over just nine of that over so this has been good finishing from sri lanka as india get to 164. they're the first t20 international here at the r premadasa and that's what sri lanka need 165 of their allotted 20 overs to take this first t20 international vervenet sure kumar has a slip for abhishek shaw woman on the other side of the circle two inside the circle on the leg oh as soon as he shows not tall enough to grab that four of the very first delivery but it could have been a wicket oh very well played got well inside the line got plenty of bat on it first ball four for me now showing his level of confidence up and oh burst through the hands i think that's hardly fun there there he catches that every single day of the week except today is that edged yes given by the empire but he'll go upstairs now i do think that's 50 50 could have struck perhaps uh the thai guardian roll forward roll forward flat line flat line when the ball passed the bet very happy to overturn his decision that was off the pipeline up in the air again this time taken come on not very smartly done by me note lucky to get away earlier this one straight to surya yadav no protection on the offside no one on the boundary so minnows looking to clear that area minot goes for 10. sri lanka 23 for one cut oh and again i think uh surya yadav got his fingertips to that and it was struck so hard straight behind the bowler very full easy pickings avishka's in good form another boundary over mid-on easy calculated and a boundary cleaned him up what a delivery he got a wicket of the first delivery in the first odi second delivery the ninja silva's inning comes to a close [Applause] what a wonderful experience delivery yeah absolute braille trimmer goes for nine sri lanka 48 for two swung away and it's gone straight into the hands of prithvi a shot sanju samson not what sri lanka wanted the said batsman taking the lone field that deep squalic sanju samson didn't have to meet an inch [Music] that sounded good and that's gone the distance welcome to the crease panda what a shot by charity look at that what a great shot young man down leg unfortunately doesn't get a boundary for that [Applause] has he done enough now let me show a little late with that dive oh that struck very well now with that go all the way and just over the boundary line about a yard or so now if you're needing to take a chance it's got to be from here charitasalanka targeting the lakeside up in the air nobody there clever shot a couple bounces for a boundary oh got him while he have a slightly slower delivery it's been hard work for pandara in the middle it's not often that you'd say but sometimes you feel a wicked could be what you need that's even as a batting unit 9 off 19 for shinbandara it's 90 for four hit hard again is that gonna go all the way and once again it just lose the man at the deep wind wicked boundary well struck indeed by a slunker shorter boundary that's where i'll go nice nice great option goes big again finds the gap this has been very good from the left-hander got it has he got it no he doesn't he doesn't that's a big big wicket for india the four man is gone just didn't quite get enough of it on the boundary sure down a deep midwicket takes the catch comfortable comfortable catch yes sir i got india one shahar's got one getting out in a crucial moment for sri lanka got it gone for 44 26. 111 [Applause] he'll probably walk to the wicket now because that's the end of hassaranga second ball the stumps have been disturbed good stuff very good led by deepak chahar inside out missing all ends up outside edge bit unlucky got to be said but saying that beautiful left it was a brief stay zero one one one for six that's gone oh yes please that'll help a lot keep the shape it is what a good shot by nathan shanaka this should get him going not going to miss out on that opportunity bisecting that long on leave me to get boundary for a six [Applause] a little inside edge an inside edge and karuna ratna is gone good time to go hard vice captain of the indian cricket team [Music] has to depart for three minutes successful man 122 [Music] and go upstairs it's a smart bit of work by shane kishan okay take it back take it back slow slow okay roll forward okay satisfied you know back foot captain making his way off the ground already the back foot raised and ishan kishan quick as a flash takes the bales off goes for 16 in trouble now 124 for eight this will be up this should be out and it's simple catch on the long arm boundary the last rights are being read here for sri lanka nine down off the bottom of the bat easy simple catch surya kumar and long on almost done for indians actually like a nine down one two five out the ground oh out out that's it that's it india have won the first t20 international here in colombo good catch by kunal pandey and dave midwicket captain and wise captain very happy with the effort of this brilliant indian cricket team coach raul gravity happy man sri lanka they won the toss and decided that they would like to chase after early rainfall and ended up being a balmy knight but india 164 for five surya kumar riyadh 50 again his great form continues ably supported by the captain shikodawan chamira bold with great pace and hasaranga ever consistent in the run chase masalanka navishka good contributions but the skillful bowling of india ensured that they were bundled out inside 19 overs 126 all out india won by 38 runs [Music] you\n",
            " edge this time gone good set of hands Aaron Finch what about the damage Mitch Starks doing at the top of the order crashed and that'll be for it didn't miss it was fought there affected point by much that's a boundary and away have some of that all the way started well in both one-day internationals and that continues so Sam who's got his first wicket it hasn't taken long either instantly hit the ball hard that should be a that's Carly jumping back in the crease again and he's outsmarted himself it's a big wicket for Australia Syd wicked well struck that's going all the way he's latched onto that Rohit Sharma the mustard nice straight that's good Betty just in the last five minutes area and has started to look comfortable get involved show your energy show your athleticism given that something is giving it everything what a way to go to 15 or they take it to him first up this outfields fast and hard it's for has he got this one yes he has sliced up and over the infield the touchscreen makes it there we go and it's made and eventually yeah he won't want to go him off that he's in such good form we want to play everything he will play a club go gannets worked hua Shan on the line of leg stamps not the place to ball Dharana [Applause] 383 was too much or inside edge very handy and that's 19 now for Sharma how do you believe that's mr. Byers oh god had beautifully thought the turns quickly for that one because that is class lock the one before yes everyone's got the big shots and loves to play the big shots but the odd have been able to get bad on ball and get off strike is huge not a good time to go down easily we've made you aware of the balls are starting to move around little that's the third man it's another one down a national hundred full of class most importantly it's been an intelligent telogen innings being duly the need hundred pork there into the attack and then a runaway fine for a boundary that's pretty easy for Dhoni and it come off the thigh back now it's been given runs the Australians two and a half hours of extra balling and runs and that's gone five two five the third man even David Warner couldn't get their singing from Sharma holding chopped it off Mitchell stock it's another important we get frustrating all class maybe too much snow give it him once again full straight the pet starts now before he's got enough on that to braid heading into the gap over the road great finish to the over by Sharma the 250s up there's a square leg back three on the offside in the deep pulled toss has he gone half no he hasn't straight to Glenn Max walk Mitchell Starks got five well Betty Polly don't worry that fatha Mitchell stocks now but seeks one back on the outside for ashlynn can't get out on ball gotta get a buyer I think the finish that's an excellent over from James Faulkner just five from it India finish at eight for 267 run rate of five point three four and it's time time for our New South Wales and Victoria Newars you're going to leave us now for the news we'll see you back here in half an hour for the Australian and run chase will be for little bit streaky but you'll take that when you're starting your innings [Applause] responsible for letting the authorities now at the time that's been crashed that would have felt good up this new blade scorching the grass very much glad you enjoy his chamois and they go show so yeah that was too expensive show me into the attack that was as easy as your life and then he helped something's why that's just a scoot so this backs working for it is off to the back there well this is up in the air this should be it and the 93rd and I was gone sure it's Ryan has got the catch that is a massive wicket for him yet he's a cagey Anne Boleyn that could well be for good sawing that for Shane Watson he's under the spinner li3 needs to do Shane Watson get himself moving second boundary or what sit down the ground now well as he finds Inari loves the MCG [Applause] one for 98 feet back so I cut through the outside there's three men on the ring no pretty quickly into position to play this shot we working out where he could score a boundary guys gone patel's go one on the stance at the right with a swift shot to be missed try it for the big shot Easter's we're talking about rotating the strike and singles spit off a little more than he could chew there Watson [Applause] placed about middlin off take Zarin Finch 250 simplest two strokes well executed yes well there's a man in film Steve Smith it's now as well not hurried in control of his game and feels like the team's in control of this game or well-placed that's what I meant about Steve Swiss hands [Applause] lovely gift yes finchy straight and he likes the look of suresh raina morphine CC balls straight down to the ground what a shot that is ladies class Steve Smith is all class we'll take another look at that after the break to 491 features been the most prominent with twos he's team twos normally there's more than that and Steve Smith these innings comes to an end Ravi Ashwin of McGuigan there's another one of those slow ball bounces from chamois with just 49 to win is it to try and get it over and done with quickly or just to give Glenn Maxwell a bit of a hit after missing out incidentally all that out yeah back in the attack was successful at Short [Applause] to new batsman the unit 5 and over it's another game now he's ducked that it's hit the periscope and fallen safely how lucky can you get completely done over and somehow it flies into safety again they've kept both men back down the ground for George Bailey clip these thoughts had on the way to to Don his gloves but he stabbed him as well the magic from ms dhoni yeah you tell your lakeside catch anyway it's just as good in that scenario oh he's smashed that it's come from nowhere maxvill goes to 11 stick or twist here he comes again it's flat enough to stay out of the hands of the fielder ten off the last two and eventful over 12 runs and a wicket now this 27 to win of 36 he's got him merci beaucoup MA sold or shipped it back and it took a good catch - he judged that will he's analyzed the boundary one bounce and over-the-road Fortner the finisher there he goes he launches here we go it's it through the offside no he doesn't hit the stops now Siegel had to hit the stumps in give it up batsman of giving it up said fine league up inside the circle third man up inside the circle through the outside hand at his best absolutely screamer this you gotta find he's done it again James thought boy he's a handy of this guy just get your home there's neat women hadn't have done a really good job in that out of 21 for this last wicket and have got a straighter over the line and they're two from two in the series well he's been a terrific game a terrific chairs by Australia India of random toss probably think that they've been twenty or thirty short but yeah well finished before live cricket all summer long Turner cricut.com Donohue / subscribe or download the app today\n",
            " starting these matches nowadays and that process must be adhered to here we go underway and through could be underway with a boundary it will just run away from you down there at these short straight boundaries [Applause] overworked that'll do nicely thank you very much it's a good first over for new zealand 12 coming from it is like all young fast bowlers oh that's what he does that's what gupta will do to that ball that's just short of the length circle and then a very backward point as well they're unlikely to have a man station there [Applause] 25 without loss i'm going to come out swinging oh so close and this should go for four as well so luck is favoring the brave right now behind square maybe gonna bowl a bit shorter no he's gonna toss it up and he's gonna get smashed over his head for six and a big one at that oh chipped it chipped it just went for four we hardly hit it now that is control that comes out the fingers differently it just took three it just took a few locks before gupta decided to climb into it and therefore the short ball doesn't work either oh he went up he went full again and he paid the price the line was different but it's just as good a result for gupta real dynamo lives and maher in the world knows that stoinis crunch one bounce for nearly six this is a start and a half beautiful oh they'll run away as well what new zealand have done tonight tarpon striker well as they've hit gats they've timed it beautifully paula monroe is looking over wide midwicket here about there and it's found it quite nicely looking and delivered that length doesn't work so well see that happening all the time oh that's lucky could run away good chase but chrislyn bails out he's had some injury problems that might have been a good goes the timing there very very good 20 rows back half a chance there you missed it 107 oh that's massive a huge strike up into the deep midwicket region and capital has 50. now monroe gets it too and monroe has 50. unbelievably good this from new zealand's point of view that could have been brilliant get your hands around that can't just carries on richardson down on the boundary wasn't that far from him early on but you get that i have capitalized oh here's another fireworks are going over the screen into the crowd a [Applause] just standing it's air time not down yet world angel tithing i don't believe it surely not surely this didn't go all the way what did it got them there in the first place it's a length ball she's going to be plenty more all the way eleven always wanted this fantastic crowd tonight just a tickle it gets to the boundary in a flash well this is how simon dole and the bulldog said that new zealanders would [Applause] straight to the field of deep square makes no mistake this is where you've got to get players trying to hit it to the longest boundaries the length there's nobody there only the camera crew 14 i don't think enough bowlers go to the yorker soon enough well that's just got an extraordinary shot it's gone up in the air i thought this will be four more perfectly placed he is on fire tonight down the ground again mid on comes in he's already said he's six more yeah this is what drives stay 88 from 47. that is massive that is just so high goodness me it certainly went higher than it went longer it's still over six trademark from gotzel not looking once he's hit it keeps the head down so far up in the air glenn maxwell even though it only went about five or six meters 94 [Applause] [Applause] has his second t200 on his backyard outstanding knock martin gupta dangerous player clean hitting of the qriket ball to all parts of the ground just checking that last one but was signaled by the field in the deep but hit the boundary on the full which is six confirmed there and hit firmly oh very clever very nifty the confidence of youth good stuff 206 for two 16 gone 44 runs conceded in two and a half overs now then this could be out should be out there's out this time maxwell gets it right and guptor's magnificent knock here at eden park comes to an end they are on their feet and so they should be good response from the crowd even the australians are getting in congratulating what was a magnificent performance from martin guptill the low full toss was the delivery that brought him undone pretty close to that waist high as well maxwell in the deep very safe hands and the end of a great knock [Applause] yeah an economy rate wise ashton agar has been the best of the australian bowlers wow that's out that's gone skiing in the most unfortunate way mark chapman has to leave the ground he's had his helmet knocked off his head back onto the stumps so billy stanley does have a save this is a dismissal you don't see very often quite a nasty one it would have been a nasty blow to the head without the helmet but uh how often do you see that and that decided to give it a go out of the old days oh that's dragged on as well beautifully bold took all the pace out of it and a few hiccups coming at the end yes inside edge this could be out as well yeah comfortably taken ty in the date again and pace is pulled back and again williamson can't find the timing yeah you're right one eighteen white smithy again is it over the top it is yes that is the late momentum and that is 50k is it i think it is got to get it in the zone tyre you've got to get it in the zone it's there taylor gets it and gets it for six to finish how appropriate is that some vic hitting from shall we say the senior man and new zealand are going to finish tonight at 243 for six and to be fair this crowd of 30 000 plus have hardly sat down through the whole 20 overs simply amazing stuff as well [Music] over the top yes it is chipped but timed from david warner 11 without loss after one [Music] two with 50 grand cats on edge go all the way as well deep over that's ridiculous [Music] it's a thick outside inside edge more luck everyone's a winner hot chocolate [Music] cricket it's earned his way into this australian side this time oh my goodness me oh you feel you feel for the bowlers surely but he's a cracking butt this is a new one thick inside edge stick outside four i was just looking to see it both of those boundary fielders out on the left down diving away tim seifert pick up four always a chance is this it's in the air a long time gets that one gets it behind square picks up four and more 16 from that over australia off to a flyer 43 without loss oh another one another inside edge might not pick up four this time so so he stopped but no he can't just kept running away from him we were just saying darcy shaw swung away will it go all the way yes it will yes it will you betcha where's mitchell is he out there high in the air and long way over long on as well another six for david warnup great striking too short too short four more adam to the extras bumble gotta get together new zealand getting away australia well he's going to have to do something because this is just becoming a riot here five men inside the circle on the off side saudi gets hit straight for six just a chip just the chip that's extraordinary let that guy's fuse now then that is massive again huge top deck west stand no doubt there six anywhere 91. that has hit so hard so hard tour delivery and australia have a hundred already [Music] david warner has 50 off just 20 balls and he isn't finished yet through the middle has been new zealand's weapon that's a bad delivery and it costs it again just being pressured into bowling mistakes [Applause] [Applause] that's the wicked new zealand needed and it was the google david warner going on the back foot to try and hit it away to the onside and misses it completely maybe just a lack of pace off the surface and straight through the end of a fine innings from the skipper 24 for one now that's is up and over and it didn't look to be that well timed solely down the ground this will test it on and off and they get nowhere near it went like a tracer bullet i know you used to be crowds but what do you think of the atmosphere here oh look it's absolutely amazing you know you talk to a few of the rugby union boys that play here all the time there's a look at that dave unfortunately what we'll do is we'll head upstairs but we'll see all the very best thanks man that takes it as martin gupta yeah look he blows the raspberry out there almost death like in the approach there this time he goes land and he gets smashed for the onside oh it's as easy and as simple as you like look out in hospitality it's coming your way i just hardly missed the blockhole but that's all it takes today another one high into the stance see he's trying to vote full and straight or full but he's missing goes short again that's risky really risky yeah and it's four more 162 for two string of wickets when no one could find the middle of the fence his wheeler and there goes wheeler it's not wheeler's night i was just going to say ben wheeler coming back for his third over having another guy and again over the offside this is in the gap too does it go all the way not quite he's come back he's pulled two balls here wheel to play the little little scoop shot now he goes short the slower ball and that is some brilliant batting that is some outstanding play well just clear thought but the task at hand that they should be tremendously confident and that helps that was just a long hot though and he just picked the spot and smashed it punched down the ground dead straight yes another boundary they are making a mockery of this quill they got him maybe a bit of bottom edge involved max was furious with himself it was on for him to close the deal as he did the other night not tonight though oh that's too high i think yeah it's been called no ball so there's going to be a free hit that is the worst possible result from new zealand's point of view oh this got away as well the bowlers get the yips uh yeah we do we do hurricanes apologize to all hurricanes fans straight up tim seifert be the man you are so using bolt has worked is there a late charge coming that is huge for new zealand bolt's the man beautiful shot wouldn't that be a ball but the way he worked it down the fine leg was superb so that's a huge australia not possible not now maybe one of the most eventful overs you'll ever see has finally come to an end 25 for one it produced absolutely chocolate sedan park sunday night [Applause] beautifully done against the angle coming into him that is superb and very clever goodness me how big is that and that is that as they say that is that the catch that means absolutely nothing to that bloke except he should hold on to the ball and put in his pocket but the fact of the matter is this that massive hit from aaron finch has put a full stop on a world record run chase by australia and can you believe it they have seven balls to spare seven balls to spare that's extraordinary\n",
            " was ballistic Ryan what about Chris Gayle na is also got to step up to the plate but we've got Paul sterling who was brilliant [Music] Praveen tombe starts off with a wide and probably four White's the presence of Chris Gayle making him ball that line just trying to keep that ball on that middle and legs jump and it lot will toss catch it as the colleague could be all over for Chris Gayle it is not finding the middle of the bat and he's gone Chris Gayle they were just sighs must have said sigh of disappointment here of course when Morgan is in the skipper at number three we'll toss will you get another response it said great response it picks up another wicked over Pluto's gold yeah that's what I'm organ sinking too low full toss just below the waist Morgan straight get four or six no you won't the sheriff up makes an early appearance look at the strike red wonderful strike rate 400 are with got powerhouses with full toss brilliant I mean picking up four wickets off football 47 year-old doing the job getting through the defenses hitting the timber and the wood and everything else talk about ripping his shorts six four three it's a drink maybe this guy ever too big of a Patrick at 42nd and what a bizarre way together the fool just ran in here you nice are getting canopy incredible Sun I'm gasping for breath Ian we've seen ball fly all over for fours and sixes and suddenly you get certainly a dream run for the 47 year old well I just refer everybody there watch the top moody tees but he's knocked over guys with yorkers very wayne panel is in 12 for five incredible night for tom be brilliant that's first runs that is considered off the bat that is beautifully struck through the offside wayne park where a shine seems a shock this is net lovely cricket stroke Wayne far now catid is the call it goes over the head of the mid off bender another for strong hit down the ground this time I only just got enough on the swine far now cuz it's skidding on as he just saying there cuttings at all man it's cleared him comfortably but yeah not that much in it it's it up in the air a brilliant catch really is a fantastic running catch it's off the turf is Paul sterling was gone wonderful piece of that elitism and it's very best floating more and more here and now the Knights of 21 for six when Knights are having a horror sure here I just knew what he had to offer both on and off the field as a good how hard is it to Don things around for it for your team you know when their first game yeah look we lost horribly but the end of the day it's just one game in the tournament and it's important that we still remain positive and with clear minds they don't need a coach jumping down the 27 for the loss of six that's a high full toss [Music] close to a hundred I can't with that put an air hostess on it it's over the roof [Applause] he's a strong striker airborne add some serious air miles on it yeah he loved it as well just a shimmy and off [Music] do 130 I was talking about it was who runs away outside edge and I won't chase it down there's some good fortune that's the 50-50 for six you know they have got the old rounders in you you always want to have your one of your regular batsmen out there throughout the 10 overs if you want to really sleep oh yeah that's a good strike please got all of that he's got the big blind and a big hit you for a six every time you bought that Blin this was a quicker delivery easy for him to just get under it and swing that back bliss always going another one that's gone for six back-to-back six [Applause] just gonna have a look and see if it goes it sit on the floor does it seeks it's two in a row this isn't it away Oh is he going out of it I think he has just it's a big iover 23 from it so it's exactly what they need a trio bits remaining then out 69 4-6 the Pepsi catch an eight-course Saturday you'll see a lot of people coming especially in the evening when the lights are on mixed up cutting out of the keeper and another week it'll fall and that was headless ran and the non-striker did not want to go wonder whether he was ball watching yeah I think he was just looking at the ball and looking at if the field is gonna miss it or not and did not hear the fall from the striker the news easy runs a big opportunity to finish it off and needle a lot of these players playing this format nicely played good deft touch flick all the way then we gotta catch the one that's going into the crowd and she kept so it looks like they're gonna surpass that it'll look like it for a while don't handle Parnell it's a little flick using the pace beautifully and it went a long way oh yeah well that's smart that's what you're talking about that's the slow ball again and moved on its way and danced away because it deserves a good dancing yeah very even final ball that's a good shot that is a really good shot that's like Shahzad yesterday [Music] and now they're 92 for seven moaning there it goes that'll be a boundary 98 they're close to a hundred what a recovery this has been by the Knights has changed and they've changed it with their lower order to bear delivery from Cuddy yeah he's looking for that your coat but yeah what a wonderful look come back you know thanks too piggish score having been five to twelve well yes well played and what a finish the Knights have recovered 103 for seven yeah that was 59 for one being in the mine the sevens we could fill 70 100 3 4 7 and look 23 from 14 and the partnerships down the bottom got them there then we're in Parnell first and bowling was superb there's a matter hog-eye me get yourself in the game in the field first ball you've got a tight Cyndi's versus Kerala nights live from Sharjah cricket stadium bill hanging in there and then Wayne Parnell with a brilliant in instance lutely is it like him I I think he's an unusual style play hits in areas that are not common and therefore he's finding gaps often as the wicked till we could just leaked four runs right who have we got Tom Curran coming on to ball yeah and he was expensive yesterday so he's got to try and find the ocean it's a smash and six be easily done by depth which he was quite expensive in particular one of his overs yesterday because of the lengthy bowls and if you've got the leverage and that ability that Dipsy chairs as most of these batsmen do it's just a natural strike it's another head down the ground couple of bounces and into the fence we talked for fours and sixes well the reason I say I think they play Tambe smartly is I think because he's such a wise campaigner and he can't get him away too often he's almost the guy were you trying not overs and then you start to look at the damage at the other guys Karen went for the thirty from his two overs yesterday and the first one went for twenty-one and straightaway look at this Rama's picked up by deficits he made it look so easy I Randy yeah just stayed where he was and use the pace and ball boy they're taking a very good catch yeah there's acreage of open area that you just think of last night after the game Karen would have been thinking right what did I do wrong that over that went for 2009 play the shots or such a glorious straight drive from Shane Watson 25 from the over it's a massive overhaul the Cyndi's 29 without a wicked tea without a wicked in 2.2 well that's how you play a t10 you've got to go for it and you take a band or any which way through the legs French cat as they say in fact behind that back leg dip stitches on strike glares the front leg and hits it sweetly into the gap what a good shot down at a time with even though it's Cpl and he's a lovely chap as well talks it simply talks himself down he said I've just to slaughter I just get out there I just don't swing the bat that's gone that's lap four six pick the wrong on and hit it across the line against us bend dips it there's magnificent tonight and how much uh can you be thinking about the wrong end of the left hand like he got the stumping yesterday that it was the length covers the thumbs and well Paul are there is so good with these caches the one hand me over steps and then the free hit it's smash for six surge ask it's over the rope but all the same it is cost plenty cost plenty now they moved to fifty seven hits it hard why not shot that is he's brilliant he's brilliant and he has to be an opener they got it wrong in the West Indies he has to bat at the top you think if it's t20 he's got six overs a pair play where it blow there he goes slicing it past the feeling for for Shane Watson because it turned out to be a no ball it's been downhill ever since that moment for North a free hit went for six deficits then took a liking and hit him hard four fours and then no i oh that's a half it that do very nicely for Shane Watson it's a big six absolutely brilliant with that straight shot well that's what I love about him he keeps it simple that's wise so consistent because it goes down the ground oh that's a big one that's done the distance and how almost hits the roof he I he loved it as well made a great sound if it got from here on in the air someone's gonna catch that it's comfortable it's did such that has to go cheeky little googly from lemak Charney yeah wanted to go big didn't get all of it that's gonna stone with useful numbers mind if it was down the line that's down the line that's over the line over the line Watson's not gonna miss our this swell set now is playing really well that's his third six off the inning is he gone with the ah that's even better it's a little flick such control here from Watson well fancy catch a crook very similar action replay stroke this one he timed it even better those in the crowd nobody giving it giving it a try to catch that maybe it did got a hand now let's just go on the other side now sees Shane Watson been through the onside time to go through they're loving it well that's a convincing win then good thing B is on he battered well in the last game the pause level very comfortable victory in the end and rightly so to the cinders and the Camden sees it all the way through with a half century little reading care we go over these red outfits Shane Watson marvelous performance after that deficits played extremely well and the captain himself the skipper Shane Watson got this is this date belongs to the bowlers we have seen a couple of head tricks and end table ever Tommy was outstanding picking up but not only five acres but major Ricketts the the veteran leg spinner absolutely tremendous and pan out and the partnership of 103 5 for 15 with 10 dots that has just obscene and T 10 units horrible start they got and in the endeavor said she just missed out on an opening stand of a she was the only wicked for her young son deep picking up his wicked for 14 and it was pretty easy for the Cindy's to get that turtle Honduran Pope one of mana the match to Praveen tombe for his five wickets including a Hetrick for maximum sixes and it's shared man white Wayne Parnell and Anton DIF such and Shane Watson to be let's not fight over this boys and it's for stylish player goes to entrant deficit 49 of 20 balls wonderful hitting from the left-hander H of the match and it goes to David Malan for taking that wonderful cash to dismiss Paul sterling [Music] you\n",
            " we are at the green park here in Kanpur we've been here many times as players before but today it feels a little special because this is now the venue for the 500 Test match for Indian cricket which is quite an achievement Ravi Shastri is here with me just four nations have managed to play 500 Test matches that's a large number and Indian cricket should be really proud of this fact absolutely because it's a long journey started in 1932 so you know you know they played all these years they've sustained the interest of the people you know Test matches were hard to come by you know in the early years but you know what's what we are seeing today is fabulous you know and we are at a heritage ground this is one of the oldest grounds in Indian cricket when India had its first original when you scan pool was one of them yes so you know it's it's amazing how history just writes his own script India played its first Test match in 1932 the hundredth Test match Mansur Ali Khan patottie was the captain happened in 1967 35 long years to play their first hundred Test matches and and again tribute there you know to the Board of Control for Cricket in India to sustain the interest you know to invite teams from overseas invite the right teams you know it would cost money you know they would want retainers they would want bank guarantees in advance but by calling those teams like the West Indies the Australians you know when New Zealand when they were strong you sustained the interest of the public you know and what you did was ensured that the Indian team got good competition and became stronger decade by decade we are talking Test match forget but you a part of that 1983 World Cup winning squad the response the reaction there was a lot of adulation fanfare but not too many financial rewards I mean that is a big change when India wins now there's also financial rewards with it no but that was the one single moment you know that redefine the way people looked at cricket in this country as a sport you know parents wanted young kids to play the game your corporate houses came behind backing the sport like never before you know the sudden interest or the just the way the cricketer was looked at by the armed junta by the the corporate crowd you know by the blue collar was totally different and India started playing well you know they they enjoyed that attention they got you know they the performance is short you won the World Championship after that you know you again staged the World Cup in India where we lost in the semi-finals but you had a sequence of good performances you know which when television came into India exploded and that's why today like I said to you earlier it's a small scale industry you mentioned it's a billion dollars porneia yeah it's a fact it's a billion dollar small scale industry is settled it yeah so much has change over the years you were being part of this whole chain this long journey as a player as a broadcaster you've also had held responsible positions within the cricket team as well if you look at Indian cricket say maybe in the 70s 80s and now 2016 what is the big change you see with the brand of cricket that India is played I think fabulous it's like I say they're the back Piper's of world cricket wherever they go you get huge audiences and obviously that has to reflect on some of the great players who played in that time you know the fact that they've handed on the baton to a good young generation who play attractive cricket and let's not forget you know it's evolved the game has evolved perfectly from India's point of view you know you have Test cricket then you have 50 over cricket and then you have twenty20 instant cricket you know which I think the game needs all three formats you know Test cricket will benefit because if the money that's made out of 50 over cricket and 2000 cricket is channeled back into the system at grassroot level you keep having a strong test team for your stew I'm glad you brought that topic on because this is not just about raving about Indian cricket this is also a time when you of course there's a cause for celebration 500 test magic this match is a big deal so you celebrate that landmark but there's also a matter of concern with regards to Test match cricket some efforts are being made to make Test cricket viable bringing the audience's people at home as well you know the that number can go bigger how do you think that that can happen and is it possible at all with the changing tastes of the modern audience it is possible if there is good competition you know if there's good competition it is very possible also I think you don't need to tweak it because luckily cricket has three formats you know you have games like football baseball they haven't changed barring one or two rules nothing has changed in over 100 years so you don't want to tweak it too much to confuse the common man you have three formats so leave Test cricket as it is for God's sake leave the ball the same red color only reason why that is being attempted Ravi's to ensure that you play at a time when people are not working yeah because when they are at work it's not possible even if they like Test match cricket to watch it and I think that is the reason why they are doing it Tampa by all means but you know I would rather have a session under that's the point you made earlier a session under light maybe three hours under lights which means you start not little late it start at 1:00 o'clock or 12:30 make sure the game gets over by 8:00 8:30 so people can go back home but the different thing you give them you don't have to change anything too much you know both sides know they will have to back one session with a red ball and the lights wickets might fall runs might be scored anything can happen but the rules stay for both sides it's how you adjust adjust ended up as long as it's not dangerous I don't think it's dangerous with lights here today and that could suddenly start getting in more people you know attractor you know make it more attractive for the television audience so as well you know these are the things you want to try and think but without trying to tweak it too much now these obviously are long-term challenges that I'm sure the world cricket is aware of it they look at this as one of the goals to achieve the challenge for Indian cricket and the BCCI is what's happening in the courts the court orders the low-doc Commission their recommendations so it's a it's a huge deal Indian cricketer you know have to tackle a lot of these recommendations which they find are unfair and might stifle the growth of Indian cricket some feel that Indian cricket will not be able to stand on its feet if all these recommendations were put into place what are your views on that see I didn't get a chance to speak to the loader committee right but they are X Supreme Court judges and they have got experience you know so obviously they've gone through a lot of stuff they've spoken to a lot of people and come up with a lot of recommendations now when it comes to governance when it comes to administration you know where if they felt that things weren't going well they've got every right to mention what can be done the same with governance another brief that they had been given was to sort out the fixing problem you know how do you sort it you know there has to be it cannot be a bill has to be passed it you know you should know what has to be done where a guy is punished in such a fashion that it deters other players from doing it it which means a recommendation to Parliament to pass a bill you know which can put a guy in the clink so that no one else will want to do it again fine but there are certain areas we know where I thought that you can still have a dialogue with the loader committee because those are things if applied it could take the game back it will be tend to become like for example the cooling-off period yeah okay why would I want to join the bc's here why would any player want to join the BCC if I have an idea that is something constructive that I can do contribute in three years you're telling me to go but what can anyone achieve in three years he gets to come back but the cooling cooling off although I know the guy and after me is competent enough if I have done a competent job I should be respected for my competency and where I think six years is no harm after that if you have to sit out for three years come back for another six fair enough but six years is enough time even the presidential candidate of the country it's a five-year term hmm you know unless something happens and there's an election in between he stays for five years you know and that's anywhere in the world yeah any other recommendation that you're eating I thought the selectors that you know three when I played the game I thought three selectors was enough but today the way the game has evolved with the three formats of the game the interest that exists in the country the combined number of people that play the game in India is more than the population of all the countries that play cricket together so if Australia has three selector that's fine it's 20 million people 17 million people here you have 1.2 billion I mean you're asking that poor guy too much you know he'll get serious travel miles yeah you know if he is one of the three will go from one end to the other of the country and still not be able to do a job I think five is still in order and another thing you know I've always believed there's no substitute for experience hmm you know we say that in cricket this is something I've learned from the sport it's something I've learned when I've interacted with people from different you know different fields in life whether its corporate whether it's sport whether its administration you name it and I certainly believe in what I am saying there's no substitute for experience and we've got a couple of guys in the board you know they're 70 plus but they'll forget a youngster they'll give anyone from any field a run for their money you know I'm not targeting anyone or anything because I've I've seen them work yep I've seen them as administrations I don't to single out or take names I've seen them working people know who I'm talking about because I don't mince words in any way but they are outstanding so you know and these things if you try and push it immediately it might just be detrimental at this moment of time so if you have to make a final sort of assessment and roundup of the load ah recommend your dialogue but still continue you know for all of you think it's a bit under it shouldn't be like a boxing bout I think there has to be some you know where genuine effort should be made you know ideally from both parties to have a dialogue on certain things which you know can work most of the recommendations are anywhere accepted and the board is trying to do something but you know this this tree cooling period is harsh and also if you want cricketers to come into the system spell out this is a professional job look wicked I will want to do a non read job yeah it's a professional job you know you you played cricket for six hours in your time you know at times when you see what people get today you got peanuts you know but then if you pay peanuts you get monkeys so get get professional professional will write the right number on the money what should be given for this job that job whatever comes their way make it professional you see a lot of cricketers coming into the system well thank you so much Rabia for talking really passionately about this it's a very sensitive topic but I've been very amazing I'm passionate Sanjay is because it's a great cricket playing country it is and if things were that bad you won't have achieved what you have achieved we're celebrating five hundred Test match you won two World Cups you're number one team in the world so all cannot be wrong yes there might have been areas which you know you needed a whack on the backside to be corrected you know but could that be the reason why some feel it's a bit extreme I won't say extreme dialogue I'm saying dialogue you know a dialogue because let's be practical if it can work or not work you know because we want Indian cricket to carry on we don't want it to go back five years you don't want this team to suffer five years you'll have they'll be total chaos other teams get the upper hand and then again you have to try and climb up the ladder dividing to be fair let's say let's get back to what is really important which is you know cricket on the field and as I said 500 tests might on this venue it said okay we've all been tests we get fans it's the ultimate test for a cricketer 500 Test match we are celebrating that today thousand Test match for India possible or you'll test cricket my struggle to read the or it can happen as easily as the last sort of 300 matches have happened see I'll tell you you know it's again personalities I believe who make the sport we had one gentleman yesterday who played 40 percent yeah okay inspire generation after generation when he played the game and there were another little fellow before him exactly and before that the spinner see every era has superstars but when you have someone like a Tendulkar who played across two and a half generations and where everyone in this team literally worships you know suddenly from this team if you get an individual you know barracks already outstanding you get two three more individuals who carry on that the good job that was done by the players earlier exactly what Kapil Dev said the other day and he's a legend the law is to take a number of people caps you know really write inspired so that will make people ten years down the line twenty years down the line wanting to play Test match cricket and twenty years

Putin Yusuf Patan the render server Joginder Sharma Rohit Sharma Harbhajan Singh RP Singh Yuvraj Singh Swisher and Robin Uthappa and of course the captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who will just connect the Madeira name furthermore so the Indian players just collecting their medallions enjoy if you can come up please many congratulations how does it feel and I think it's one of the things that I've achieved in the last three at one of the things I treasure for the whole life in the rest of my life and I think it's really amazing I'm really excited and I would like to congratulate the boys over there and likely thanks them for the effort and for the response that they have given me I think it was really amazing the young side event we came to the tournament no one expected us to win and the way we have won the final match I think we deserve a big celebration Pakistan did extremely well to restrict you to 160 and they played good figure as well I think the ball very well you know it the wicket was not really doing too much but I think from the 12th or onwards the way good and Arafat Bowl I think that was really really really excellent but we knew one thing we scored 150 or 160 still they have to score it and we always know the run rate it's always always over six so if you get quick quick wickets and later on if I can pressurize the bats when it gets really hard now what was happening in those final two overs there must have been a lot of thoughts going through your mind choking the sharma Harbhajan Singh Joginder Sharma Harbhajan Singh what made you give Joginder that last over I think but he was 100 wasn't sure and I was not getting the yorkers right so I felt you know instead of giving up bowler was not hundred percent sure I should give a bowler who wants to do well at that international never even if I if we would have lost the match it doesn't matter to me but I think the way Jogi Bowl it was really good now what does this be to you this you know what would you think this would do for Indian to do well one thing for sure the 2020 version will catch up in India the excitement and the type of game it is I think it will be a big hit in India apart from that I think now after we lost after the way we departed from the World Cup initially you know in 2007 I think it will do it will do the repair work for some time and we have to keep keep doing it in Australian series followed by Pakistan then we are off to Australia so we have to do consistently well now before you go here this out the BCCI has announced an award of two million dollars for the Indian team and a core of repairs for your rats in for hitting his six sixes in an oval na manja you can go up and collect the big one the world twenty20 Champions India and when the same Tony gets the award from mr. Ramani where the fireworks have started here it's time for the Indian team to look it's been an outstanding performance and these are scenes have been watched by millions around the world there will be fireworks with India for sure but at the end of it all it's been a magnificent tournament beautifully organized and like I mentioned at the start a massive massive success India the world TT champions pictures that they would savor for a very long time to come young man with ambition in their heart and they arrived there with no one expecting them to win and they've gone on to win the first edition of crickets youngest child they'll pump their fists and they'll let that dreams fly today it was an absolutely fantastic moment two young teams two unheralded teams have given this ICC World twenty20 the best advertisement it could have could have ever got this was this was absolutely fantastic - Nguni the young man will embrace each other all night these are moments you cherish if you're near a sportsman you want to live trophies you want the world to watch you wanna have little memories that you're gonna keep by with you and these are fantastic memories books really gospel drum is Raja know what it is to have lifted the World Cup and I'm sure you know what they're going through just now oh yes I know I think it's just gonna be you know for us for starters they'll just be screaming they won't be saying anything they'll just be saying here whatever it is and that's it they will be doing nothing else excepting screaming and by the time they get back to the dressing room they'll be exhausted by all the screaming and then they'll start and have a bit of champagne to to you know to get rid of the past and dry throats and then after the champagne is sunk in after a couple of glasses of champagne or something then they won't remember what they do they go I think they'll start screaming again clouds have been fantastic as well it's been a very well-supported tournament this the ICC World twenty20 as Robbie said in the presentation very well-organized tournament all of us who enjoyed being here and at last we got a final to remember when you've been through so many finals that have turned out to be anticlimax isn't your class got a final backrooms the tournament deserve oh absolutely I think coming so close by for that football for the finals was just the right kind of finals that you would want because really it was it was a very very close again that's the kind of game that you want to wonder what I think this victory certainly will help mind us in Dhoni to become a better leader because he's been fantastic Travis t20 competition but I think it'll lift him as a leader because he did have the stars with him we had a young team and to win a world away but just been fantastic yes they'll be enjoying that as well he's built with this chapter India anthem is virtually being an ambassador so that's the way it's looking at the moment India that crowd winners of the first ICC was 2020 and as the celebrations continue we'll take a little break back in just a normal enjoyed yourself to\n",

            " a wise person once told me dreams don't work unless you do we're trying so hard in our lives to fit in we try to fit into certain groups certain threats certain sororities you know among certain friends yet the people we idolize are most are the ones that stand out but when you're prepared there is no fear there is no fear of failure because even if you've walked out of something and you feel like you failed at it your preparation is so strong that you're gonna take that failure and turn it into the outcome you desire and most people stop at failure okay we've all failed at things i'm going to continue to fail at stuff right it's the most powerful tool you can use but it all depends on how you use it what would your future be like if you decided to to want that which you desire so strongly that it prepares you past your fears that you experience the fear as the one book says feel the fear and do it anyway life is 10 percent what happens to you it's 90 what you do about it no matter who you are no matter where you are in life you can take the lid off of your jaw and and if if you're wondering if you still have the lid on in your life here are some clues that's going to let you know that the lid is still on if you're not excited about waking up in the morning if you're sitting around bored out of your mind if you got time to do everything anybody asks you to do you probably got the lid on if when you tell your dreams to all your friends it makes sense to them you got your lead on man your dreams should be should not make sense to everybody you got to say something to make people go how you going to do that that's when you got the lid off and if i were you i'd do that i take the lid off makes sense to me they're always going to get ready to get set to get going what we've got to do is boom just like that move into action every time you remember your dream you're removing some dirt you're digging it back out the true mark of a champion is even though some dirt gets thrown on your dream instead of letting it get buried you keep shaking it off you keep moving forward you keep looking for a new opportunity you wouldn't be having that opposition if you didn't have something great in you if your dream wasn't alive and on track right on schedule to come to pass you wouldn't have so many things coming against you that dream is still alive you may have tried a year ago five years ago or 40 years ago didn't work out nobody was there to help you go back and try again this is your time this is your moment your destiny is calling out to you can i tell you your dream is not dead it's just not in season your time is coming promotion is coming good breaks are coming promises you've been standing on dreams you've been praying about lack is not your destiny constantly struggling barely getting by is not the end of your story these light afflictions are for a moment the adversity is temporary the glory is eternal [Music] lord i believe this is my year to get healthy and hope this is my year to meet the people of my dreams this is my year to go further in my career to step into a new level of my destiny this is my year to accomplish dreams to break free from this depression this is my year to meet the right people this is my year to get healthy and whole this is your year to see double this is your year for vindication for restoration for new beginnings now get your mind going in the right direction here's the secret the people that do the most with their lives the people that seem the most self-assured the ones that seem to embody confidence the ones that seem to define confidence they're the ones that had to face down the most fear they simply didn't linger in it don't hate your competitors respect your competitors learn from him i had a very important person my life come to me and say who's your hero and i said i don't know i gotta think about that give me a couple of weeks i said i thought about it you know who it is i said it's me in 10 years so i turned 25 10 years later that same person comes being though so are you a hero and i was like not even close she said why is it because my hero is me at 35 so you see every day every week every month and every year in my life my hero's always 10 years away i'm never going to be a hero i'm not going to obtain that i know i'm not that's just fine with me because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chase that's the thing success and failure are generally slow processes either slowly building things up or gradually tearing them down and that's why i say you've got to pay attention you have to watch you have to watch every single second choose love and don't ever let fear turn you against your playful heart i believe in manifestation i believe in putting a rocket of desire out into the universe and and you get it when you believe it you get it when you believe you have it and that's the key so we want to get really sensitized acutely sensitized sensory acuity to whether what we're doing is working or not and by the way sensory acuity is really the measure of a person's intelligence what i mean by that is how do we measure intelligence intelligence is a measure of the number and quality of distinctions you have in a given situation you can handle this you just haven't figured it out yet it's all right this is your training period this is the tuition you have to pay for what you don't know you can do this other people have done it doesn't take an einstein get you some people that can teach you some stuff that you don't know get you some people that have done it successfully and learn from them take some seminars workshops read some books on how to manage a business change the way you see yourself and begin to tend to the personal details understand that nobody's going to take care of your business better than you you will notice the most successful people in any field they are usually the ones who have failed more than anybody else you see the difference between a successful person and everyone else it's not a lack of strength it's not a lack of knowledge it's a lack of will [Music] you must experience what this life is totally isn't it before you go you must experience this if you do experience that then such questions will never arise in your mind because that's not the way existing things [Music] it's up to you in a world where we're taught to look outside for answers for a job that will make us happy for money that will make us happy that answer is within we already have it we already have the answer but will we unleash it will we give it will we own it will we truly reinvent ourselves to become the people that were capable of becoming the bow too tightly strung as easily broken says one of the problems balance is a gorgeous thing so be monomaniacal in your execution around your high value targets your hvts your mission plan but also build in some rewards and that's going to send a gorgeous message to your conscious and your subconscious mind that hey this daily practice of execution around my deliverables is a beautiful thing and you create this thing called momentum and the monk who sold his ferrari i went back and i saw this recently i think there's a whole chapter on momentum and you become like this i love skiing you start off small but as you go down the slope you pick up momentum a lot of people say robin where do i start i want to start a new business i want to become a better artist i want to find the love of my life i want to be a world-class creative i want to multiply my financial life where do i start you just start you just start there's great power in the start and when you start life starts supporting well god wants us all to be courageous because he knows we'll face times in life and situations and circumstances that it takes more than just the desire takes courage [Music] many people operate on the basis of fear on the basis of what other people think we as believers should operate on the basis of courage courage to say no and we ought to say no courage to say yes when we should say yes so what kind of courage do you have is your sort of floating between depending on the situation or do you know the difference between right and wrong for your life and you've made up your mind you\n",
            " today i want to tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories [Music] the first story is about connecting the dots [Music] i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months or so before i really quit so why'd i drop out it started before i was born biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we've got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and seventeen years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford and all of my working class parents savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldn't see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasn't all romantic i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example reed college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life but 10 years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac it's likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards 10 years later again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference [Music] my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i loved to do early in life woz and i started apple in my parents garage when i was 20. we worked hard and in 10 years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned 30 and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at 30 i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didn't know what to do for a few months i felt that i'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit i'd been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the likeness of being a beginner again less sure about everything it freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apple's current renaissance and laureen and i have a wonderful family together i'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadn't been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick don't lose faith i'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you haven't found it yet keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle my third story is about death when i was 17 i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years i've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something remembering that i'll be dead soon is the most important tool i've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it's life's change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish\n",

your brain is the only thing you have when you're going through depression when you're going through hard times you're going through death real life you can't Google that man you're alone you're alone you may have a shrink you're going to you may have a best friend you going to but there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone in this brain and your brain is talking to you in all kind of ways and it wants to control you and pull you in these different pockets if you can't control your own brain and your brain controls you you're you got to tell your brain where you want to go and how you want to go and how you want to get there you got to control it if not it's over but existed for me was okay man how am I gonna make this work and all I knew back then was hard work the only way anything gets accomplished that's all I heard back in those days you got to work hard you got to work hard I'm not getting how did I can't get this paragraph I can't remember what this paragraph to pass this test to get the military breathe again I'm still not getting it read again but it's not getting it write it out and now I started learning okay well I can't I gotta write out everything I do and then write it out again and write it out again and guess what happened I got it I got it I can't swim I'm negative buoyant go back again I can't swim go back again go back again go back again I got it I realize if I keep going back and going back and going back until this just becomes your mind was safe okay we're gonna figure it out because he is not going to stop it's like I'm gonna try one more time no I'm gonna it's just like long clock goes off Boop we're going back I can't read right we're going back I gave myself no way out and my mind realized that they said okay we're gonna adapt and overcome now like a lot of people say trying hard they your mind knows man it knows this guy's bull guys lying there's no truth behind it when I was a Navy SEAL training people oh how are you there for 18 months the program is always six months long you were in three hell weeks in one year no one's ever done that how did you do that I talked about the new norm when I lived in the $7 a month place and I was growing up for a short period of time I loved it I don't know you know any different that was my norm once we move down that place we moved to $236 month place I was like I never want to go back to that little pieces but if you go back to that seven dollar month place and you realize this is where I live that's all I got your mind says Roger that this is home so when I was going to Navy SEAL training for 18 months and going back through all the hard part's over and over again I told myself after the first time I knew this could be a long journey there my body was breaking down it was it was just how it was going on I see know what this is my new normal so my mind said is that going to work like you go to work you put your suit I on I'm going to suffering every day every day suffering being broken duct taping my feet up stress fracture shin splints being broken this is my new norm and your mind says if we're not broken just say normal we got to be broken so then your mind starts to get tougher and tougher and more cast people huh how did you run on broken feet broken broken shins my mind knew this is how we operate we're a Navy SEAL training this is what we are I health and that became my new norm I gave myself no way out there was nothing outside these walls of hell nothing I became I love God but for a short period of time I became the devil because that was hell I became I became the boss the owner the CEO of Navy SEAL training that was my mindset and that's how you get through things you put yourself you immerse yourself wherever it is you become that you become that and give yourself nowhere yeah when I was tours in 97 pounds and I was fat as hell trying to be a Navy SEAL the scariest thing in the world to me even to this day was that that could have been the rest of my life I thought then I was trying hard that's the scariest thing in the world I thought then two or 97-pound working for Ecolab's spraying for cockroaches making $1,000 a month I thought that was me at my 100% potential come to find out a few years later I wasn't even near that 106 pounds less graduating Navy SEAL training we don't do all these other things looking back on that that was me trying hard that's why people got understand what is in us we have no idea until we start trying hard and I mean really trying hard where you're obsessed with hey this is my new norm my new norm is that wow this isn't always fun it's not always meant to be fun and that's when you know you're trying hard people hear my story and think this guy's sadistic I realize how the how the brain works I figured out how the brain works I'm a scared kid and that's what gives me so much power I had no foundation and I built this off of just researching the mind the feeling you get is basically invincibility you realize that you can't do it all the time when you need to do it I know I can go to a place that I can live in and when you know that you can run on broken legs and you can do certain things that a lot of people can do but they're not willing to do this power this sympathetic nervous system of fight or flight and you're fighting it gives you this charge of energy over when you're sitting there at 3:30 4:00 o'clock in the morning and you're duct taping your feet up because they're broken and you're doing it by yourself and you're going to do arguably one of the hardest training in the world and these guys most of them are healthy and you're going through it broken and you already at a disadvantage but you're still there you can feed into that and tap into that for a lot of power but if you look at it while I'm broken man like I'm not gonna make it if you look at it as man I'm broken and I'm still here and I'm fighting and I'm gonna find a way to get through this because I have no other place to go it gives you a lot of power when things start to suck really really bad my brain and a lot of people's brain DUP they don't go to your dad beating you up your brain says win it right here this is miserable so anger goes away a lot of times when you're suffering because your brain that says we got a run we got to go so that anger is not popping up saying oh I'm gonna show them I want to show those people no there has to be a much deeper if I say deeper it has to be down to mineral mineral soil it has to be down to that nice mineral soil where nothing can burn you can't burn dirt so it has to be down that low that literally is submenu that's at the core your soul and but you but you don't find it unless you spend a lot of time with what you want to be in life you I can't give that to you right you can't give it to somebody when when you find your true passion in life and my passion for me when like I want to be now given my Navy SEALs I mean roundish I want to serve my country I cared about I want to be someone that I'm proud of I want to look at myself in American I was so disappointed that accountability man I talked about I was so disappointed in what I saw every day I want everybody to love David Goggins and a lot of people did I didn't love myself but I knew a lot of us want to find peace first so gonna say man you always talk about this suffering and pain --is-- I'm at peace right now because I'm going to do that you don't find peace first if you do Merry Christmas more power to you more power to you I found peace on the opposite end of finding myself and no one really finds himself without going through trials tribulations suffering accountability and accountability is suffering being accountable every day for doing right for yourself for the people next to you it's miserable it's hard so you know even the smallest details you\n",
            " Today, I need you to embrace what comes hard to day I need you to accept the challenge  Today I need you to fall in love with the process  There will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged,  to lose your passion  and think that it's not meant to be. But if you're going to reach your destiny,  you have to have a made-up mind. If you give up after the first time  or the fifth time or the 30th time,  what that really means is you didn't want it bad enough. There should be something you're believing for that you are relentless. You are not moved by how impossible it looks,  you're not discouraged by how long it's taking,  you don't give up because people told you no, you're attitude is,  \"If I have to believe my whole life,  I am not going to stop believing,  I am not going to take no for an answer,  I'm not going to settle for mediocrity,  I'm going to keep pursuing   what put in my heart.\" and ask ourself, \"What do I really want?\" What do I really want? And write it down. Writing causes thinking, thinking creates an image and you get these images  And you get this images growing,  your building a vision in your mind. It's the visionaries. That's changed the world. Think of that. But what keeps that competitive edge What keeps you on top is the ability to think  and prepare mentally over and over and over again. The body has limitations. The mind does not. We focus so much  on what goes on the neck down that we forget it all starts from here. Everything starts from there If you're not mentally ready,  you're never really physically prepared. And that's where the preparation starts. What would your life be like?  As you look toward the future, if you decided I'm not going to allow my fears to stop me. And I'm saying to you, whatever you gotta do, Do it. Because if your don't life is gonna whoop you until you surrender. So when you're young and you make mistakes, don't let 'em eat you up, 'cause everybody that done made it done made 'em. You got to fail in order to win. Hey, look, man. To understand how to hit the game when it's shot, you got to miss the game when it's shot. You know, you got to be tough because  the road to success is always under construction. It's never a clear path to success. The people who become successful are the people who have a relentless attitude. And you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks, 'cause the bad breaks is comin', but they usually come right before the big break is about to happen. You get a series of bad breaks and it stumbles up a lot of people. My life and my success is to say to anyone, \"You can stumble, you can fall, you can get back up again.\"\n",

the one you're capable of living now i'm sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life i'm sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on make sure you got something to fall back on honey but i never understood that concept having something to fall back on if i'm going to fall i don't want to fall back on anything i want to fall forward i figure at least this way i'll see what i'm going to hit without consistency you'll never finish so do what you feel passionate about passionate about take chances don't be afraid to fail there's an old iq test was nine dots and you had to draw five lines with a pencil within these nine dots without lifting the pencil the only way to do it was to go outside the box don't be afraid to think outside the box don't be afraid to fail big to dream big but remember dreams without goals are just dreams reggie jackson struck out 2600 times in his career the most in the history of baseball but you don't hear about the strikeouts people remember the home runs [Music] fall forward thomas edison conducted 1 000 failed experiments did you know that i didn't know that because the one thousand and first was the light bulb [Music] fall forward every failed experiment is one step closer to success got to take risks and i'm sure you've probably heard that before but i want to talk to you about why that's so important you will fail at some point in your life it you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something there's no doubt about it and i know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony but hey i'm telling you embrace it because it's inevitable in the acting business you fail all the time early on in my career i auditioned for a part in a broadway musical perfect role for me i thought except for the fact that i can't sing i didn't get the job but here's the thing i didn't quit [Music] i didn't fall back i walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition i prayed i prayed and i prayed but i continued to fail and fail and fail but it didn't matter because you know what there's an old saying you hang around the barber shop long enough sooner or later you're gonna get a haircut so you will catch a break and i did catch a break [Music] last year i did a play called fences on broadway but here's the kicker it was at the court theater it was at the same theater that i failed that first audition 30 years prior the point is every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed but do you have the guts to fail if you don't fail you're not even trying [Music] i'll say it again if you don't fail you're not even trying to get something you never had you have to do something you never did imagine you're on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of the ideas you never acted on the ghost of the talents you didn't use and they're standing around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together so i ask you today [Music] how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes [Music] i just got back from south africa it's a beautiful country but there are places there with terrible private poverty that need help and africa is just the tip of the iceberg the middle east needs your help japan needs your help alabama needs your help tennessee needs your help louisiana needs your help philadelphia needs your help the world needs a lot and we need it from you we really do we need it from you young people i mean i'm not speaking for the rest of us up here but i know i'm getting a little grayer we need it from you the young people because remember this you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got

you are theologians nurses sociologists some of you have money some of you have patience some of you have kindness some of you have loved some of you have the gift of long-suffering whatever it is whatever your gift is what are you going to do with what you have all right now here's my last point about failure sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going your life will never be a straight path i began at fordham university as a pre-med student i took a course called the [Music] cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it i couldn't say it i surely couldn't pass it so then i decided to go into pre-law then journalism and with no academic focus my grades took off in their own direction i was a 1.8 gpa and the university very politely suggested that it might be better to take some time off i was 20 years old i was at my lowest point and then one day and i remember the exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my mother in her beauty shop my mother owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon and there's there was this older woman who was considered one of the elders in the town and i didn't know her personally but i was looking in the mirror and every time i looked in the mirror i could see her behind me and she was staring at me she just kept looking at me every time i looked at her she kept giving me these strange looks so she finally took the dryer off her head and said she said something i'll never forget she said young boy i have a prophecy a spiritual prophecy she said you are going to travel the world and speak to millions of people [Music] and in the years that follow just as that woman prophesies i have traveled the world and i have spoken to millions of people through my movies millions who up until this day couldn't see me who up till this day i couldn't see while i was talking to them and they couldn't see me they could only see the movie they couldn't see the real me [Music] but i see youth today [Music] and i'm encouraged by what i see i'm strengthened by what i see [Music] because taking risk is not just about going for a job it's also about knowing what you know and what you don't know it's about being open to people and to ideas the chances you take the people you meet the people you love the faith that you have that's what's going to define you never be discouraged never hold back give everything you got and when you fall

you get to move on if you really get the lesson you pass and you don't have to repeat the class if you don't get the lesson it shows up wearing another pair of pants to give you some remedial work and what i found is that difficulties come when you don't pay attention to life's whisper because life always whispers to you first first and if you ignore the whisper sooner or later you'll get a scream

with my mother for part of my life and i remember the best christmas of my life was when i was 12 years old and my mother had said we're not going to have christmas because we can't afford it i remember feeling like it's going to be really hard on christmas morning to go outside what am i going to do when everybody else is outside that's what i thought what am i going to do when everybody else is outside and what am i going to do when i have to go back to class and say i got nothing so that's what i was mostly worried about and then some nuns showed up some three nuns came to our house and they gave me a doll and they bought us food and we had our christmas that was the best christmas of my life because somebody remembered and i wasn't going to have to be the kid that said i got nothing so i wanted to be able to create that same feeling for children who had nothing so i decided to go to south africa originally i wanted to do a million kids and then just realized with i only had four weeks vacation so in four weeks i could not reach a million kids because i didn't want to just write a check send a donation i wanted to be able to look in each kid's face and say to that child somebody remembered you and so that's what i did with my life this christmas i took 41 people from here hired another 50 people over there and we were traveling caravan from one village to the next we did 2 000 kids a day we had parties for children who were orphans and it was singularly i will tell you i could weep thinking about it the singularly the best experience of my life the singularly best experience of my life the first day in africa where we had 280 kids in a room and every single one of those kids had lost a parent every single one of those children they were aged three to 17 in that room and my team that you're talking about i have the greatest team in the world my team in the here in the united states had been in contact with the orphanages so that by the time we got there we had a present with every child's name on it this summer every black doll manufacturer in the country had sent me dolls because i these girls had never seen black dolls and so it was my mission to do for them what the nuns had done for me was to let the african girls see a black doll so i wanted every girl to have a black doll i wanted every boy to have soccer balls we bought radios we bought clothes and the most important thing is we had their names on every box for every child and i called up the children one by one and when those children you know received their gifts and then waited for the next child to receive their gifts and said i said nobody can open their presents until everybody can open their presents and on the count of three when i counted the three and those children open their presents was the single greatest moment of my life i have a big life so i can take 50 000 presents and do that over and over and over again to orphanage effort orphanage but what i felt in that room for those from those kids is a lot of what you're talking about and what you're talking about and what you see in the faces of those women when you look into the eyes of someone and you give them a gift whether that be a physical gift or it be a gift from your spiritual self from your presence from the essence of you and you see the light you see the joy what i felt in that room was not just that i was remembered that the child felt that i was remembered but you felt a sense of hope a sense of validation a sense of validation that somebody cared about me and i will tell you that of all the years and shows that i have done and every theme for every show that i've done the single common dynamic denominator that i've found that every human being is looking for is validation every single person needs to know wants to feel that they matter that they matter and what happened in that room that was the greatest day of my life i knew that those children knew in that moment that they mattered that they mattered and so i encourage you it's exciting to be able to write a check it's even more exciting to be able to touch one life to be able to do that for one person it's like cynthia was saying when you can do that for one person when you can do that you will know that your life has meaning and i will tell you when i left that place my friend gail and i were there and we're all boohoo and we're like boom with the children oh my gosh and gail was saying what is it what is it we're so full as gail said to me she said you know as big as your show is as big as your show is what happened in that room seemed bigger what happened in that room sing bigger and that is true that is true for me who has this big life in a television show and i'm telling you for everybody here extending yourself beyond your world your kids your family your stuff and reaching out to somebody who is not like you somebody who is like you who is indeed if you are feeling depressed or you are feeling down or you're feeling like things aren't going the way you want them to go in your life the way you turn that around is to reach outside of yourself to somebody else reach outside of yourself to somebody else it will change you it will change you so it is my intention my intention to fulfill the dream of the creator it is my intention to live to the highest calling and be pressed to the mark of the highest calling that i have come to do and when you can ask the creator ask that which made you you what is your dream for me i guarantee you instead of you trying to define the dream what is your dream for me if you're able to lean into the dream that the universe and all the forces of of of of light and love and power and grace by all the names that we call god has for you nobody can touch you nobody can touch you [Music] so [Music] you\n",

            " . wow . the attention of the qriketing world . returns once again to the capital city . of sri lanka colombo and to their . biggest cricket stadium as we pick up . the t20 series . the first of three news from the middle . sri lanka have won the toss they can . have a ball first . the two teams lots of changes a few . new faces in both teams sri lanka . handing out two debuts . one to charitas and charming . the other india handing out two caps as . well to crippy shaw . and baron . beautifully bowled beautifully bald they . struck early . they have first ball pretty sure goes . what a lovely delivery that was . it swings late and the line was such . that pritisho had to play at it . jamiro strikes . pretty sure without scoring not for one . india . boundary a boundary to end the second . 12 for one . shot great shot wonderful from sanji . sampson . that's four more four more . is it carried has it carried he loves . the catch . they're gonna have a little look . upstairs they're gonna have a little . look upstairs . let's have a look for the soft signal . which the umpires reckon is a no . let's have a listen . oh what do you make of that what do you . make of that the soft signal is no . i'm gonna go with knot out i think that . bounces just before his fingers . but he saved his team four that was . racing away i think the right decision . right now the skipper in the company of . sanjay samson . going along well that's the first big . hit and that's massive . straight behind the baller and well . beyond the side screen as well . picking it early not an easy bowler to . come down to akilah the ninja . delivery well done indeed . sanju samson dead as a duck . strikes of the very first delivery he . bowls . india 51 for two sanju samson goes for . 27. . ripped away in the gap and that's four . short and that had to be put away in the . gap . and sodium . but dealt with . very clever . indeed . got it has he got it you bet he has . all the way what a shot against the spin . this time captain shaker darwin chancing . his arms . there you go knocked each other but . still went through it . first six in three innings . the mystery spinner aquila is coming . under pressure it's gone for 35 and he . hasn't completed three . and that should be four as well that's . beautifully struck . too much flight for the said batsman . swept away he's found the gap he's found . the gap and he's hit it well enough . that's not a good sight let's hope it's . a passing shower . chance in the deep chance in the deep . oh nearly misjudged it as well . has he got enough he doesn't he doesn't . he doesn't have enough he's gone . another soldier by champ this time . sheikha down . finds that lone fielder at deep . squaligashin bandara . it's a good running catch the most . important wicket . for the sri lankan the two better . stealing batsman going there . a wicket on debut flicked away there's a . man in the deep . he has to make up a little bit to his . right . that holds on to it and yes you should . celebrate the first of many maybe . for karuna ratner the captain played . well shika darwin . he played well but in the end he goes . for 46 indian r1 . 13 for three . got it he's got this one yes yes . that's a biggie . he's looked to go this side of the . ground . fairly often it's the shorter side again . slower ball this time he's picked it . and he knows there's plenty of space . square of the wicket . crucial over hasaranga . starts off well surya kumar yadav . that's this half century 33 balls . he's a special player just look at that . able to hit it on the up hit it straight . hit it clean . should be taken will be taken he has the . last laugh . plays with a lot of heart that's exactly . what he is telling everyone . this clever bowling deceives a man on . fire . sure mariada cannot believe what he's . just done . will that go for four that's speeding . away yes it does . so ishan kishan into the act . oh that's one heart should go all the . way . six runs to ishan kishan . kishan is deep inside the crease though . slightly . but what works in his favor is the extra . pace that . offered him on that occasion . that's been swung away is that sweet . or dropped . didn't hang on . it's a long boundary there very long . boundary . one big one for chamira he's been very . very good . 10 off 12 india 153 for five . that's been swung away but not powerful . enough . for it to find the boundary so just one . of the last ball of the 20th over . just nine of that over so this has been . good finishing . from sri lanka as india get to 164. . they're the first t20 international here . at the r premadasa and that's what sri . lanka need . 165 of their allotted 20 overs . to take this first t20 international . vervenet sure kumar has a slip for . abhishek . shaw woman on the other side of the . circle two inside the circle on the leg . oh as soon as he shows not tall enough . to grab that . four of the very first delivery but it . could have been a wicket . oh very well played got well inside the . line got plenty of bat on it . first ball four for me now showing his . level of confidence . up and oh burst through the hands . i think that's hardly fun there there . he catches that every single day of the . week . except today . is that edged yes given by . the empire but he'll go upstairs now . i do think that's 50 50 could have . struck perhaps uh . the thai guardian . roll forward roll forward . flat line flat line when the ball passed . the bet . very happy to overturn his decision that . was off the pipeline . up in the air again this time taken come . on . not very smartly done by me note lucky . to get away earlier . this one straight to surya yadav . no protection on the offside no one on . the boundary so . minnows looking to clear that area . minot goes for 10. sri lanka 23 for one . cut oh and again i think uh surya yadav . got . his fingertips to that and it was struck . so . hard . straight behind the bowler very full . easy pickings . avishka's in good form another boundary . over mid-on easy calculated . and a boundary . cleaned him up what a delivery he got a . wicket of the first delivery in the . first odi . second delivery the ninja silva's inning . comes to a close . what a wonderful experience delivery . yeah absolute braille trimmer . goes for nine sri lanka 48 for two . swung away and it's gone straight into . the hands . of prithvi a shot . sanju samson not what sri lanka wanted . the said batsman . taking the lone field that deep squalic . sanju samson didn't have to meet an inch . that sounded good and that's gone the . distance . welcome to the crease panda what a shot . by charity . look at that what a great shot young man . down leg unfortunately doesn't get a . boundary for that . has he done enough now let me show a . little late with that dive oh that . struck very well now with that go all . the way . and just over the boundary line about a . yard or so . now if you're needing to take a chance . it's got to be from here charitasalanka . targeting . the lakeside . up in the air nobody there clever shot . a couple bounces for a boundary oh . got him while he . have a slightly slower delivery it's . been hard work for pandara . in the middle it's not often that . you'd say but sometimes you feel . a wicked could

            " . edge this time gone good set of hands . Aaron Finch what about the damage Mitch . Starks doing at the top of the order . crashed and that'll be for it didn't . miss it was fought there affected point . by much . that's a boundary . and away have some of that all the way . started well in both one-day . internationals and that continues so Sam . who's got his first wicket it hasn't . taken long either . instantly hit the ball hard that should . be a that's Carly . jumping back in the crease again and . he's outsmarted himself it's a big . wicket for Australia Syd wicked well . struck . that's going all the way he's latched . onto that Rohit Sharma . the mustard nice straight . that's good Betty just in the last five . minutes area and has started to look . comfortable get involved show your . energy show your athleticism given that . something is giving it everything what a . way to go to 15 . or they take it to him first up this . outfields fast and hard it's for . has he got this one yes he has sliced up . and over the infield the touchscreen . makes it there we go . and it's made and eventually yeah he . won't want to go him off that he's in . such good form we want to play . everything he will play a club go . gannets worked hua Shan on the line of . leg stamps not the place to ball Dharana . 383 was too much or inside edge very . handy and that's 19 now for Sharma how . do you believe that's mr. Byers . oh god had beautifully thought the turns . quickly for that one because that is . class lock the one before yes everyone's . got the big shots and loves to play the . big shots but the odd have been able to . get bad on ball and get off strike is . huge not a good time to go down easily . we've made you aware of the balls are . starting to move around little . that's the third man it's another one . down a national hundred . full of class most importantly it's been . an intelligent . telogen innings being duly the need . hundred pork there into the attack and . then a runaway fine for a boundary . that's pretty easy for Dhoni . and it come off the thigh back now it's . been given runs the Australians two and . a half hours of extra balling and runs . and that's gone five two five the third . man . even David Warner couldn't get their . singing from Sharma holding chopped it . off Mitchell stock it's another . important we get frustrating all class . maybe too much snow give it him . once again full straight . the pet starts now before he's got . enough on that to braid heading into the . gap over the road great finish to the . over by Sharma the 250s up there's a . square leg back three on the offside in . the deep pulled toss has he gone half no . he hasn't . straight to Glenn Max walk Mitchell . Starks got five . well Betty Polly . don't worry that fatha Mitchell stocks . now but seeks . one back on the outside for ashlynn . can't get out on ball gotta get a buyer . I think the finish . that's an excellent over from James . Faulkner just five from it India finish . at eight for 267 run rate of five point . three four and it's time time for our . New South Wales and Victoria Newars . you're going to leave us now for the . news we'll see you back here in half an . hour for the Australian and run chase . will be for little bit streaky . but you'll take that when you're . starting your innings . responsible for letting the authorities . now at the time that's been crashed that . would have felt good up this new blade . scorching the grass very much glad you . enjoy his chamois and they go show so . yeah that was too expensive . show me into the attack that was as easy . as your life and then he helped . something's why that's just a scoot so . this backs working for it . is off to the back there well this is up . in the air this should be it . and the 93rd and I was gone sure it's . Ryan has got the catch that is a massive . wicket for him yet he's a cagey Anne . Boleyn that could well be for . good sawing that for Shane Watson he's . under the spinner li3 needs to do Shane . Watson get himself moving second . boundary or what sit down the ground . now well as he finds Inari loves the MCG . one for 98 feet back so I cut through . the outside there's three men on the . ring no . pretty quickly into position to play . this shot we working out where he could . score a boundary guys gone patel's go . one on the stance at the right . with a swift shot to be missed try it . for the big shot Easter's we're talking . about rotating the strike and singles . spit off a little more than he could . chew there Watson . placed . about middlin off . take Zarin Finch 250 simplest two . strokes well executed yes . well there's a man in film . Steve Smith . it's now as well not hurried in control . of his game and feels like the team's in . control of this game or well-placed . that's what I meant about Steve Swiss . hands . lovely gift yes finchy straight and he . likes the look of suresh raina morphine . CC balls . straight down to the ground what a shot . that is ladies class Steve Smith is all . class we'll take another look at that . after the break to 491 features been the . most prominent with twos he's team twos . normally there's more than that and . Steve Smith these innings comes to an . end . Ravi Ashwin of McGuigan . there's another one of those slow ball . bounces from chamois with just 49 to win . is it to try and get it over and done . with quickly or just to give Glenn . Maxwell a bit of a hit after missing out . incidentally all that out yeah back in . the attack was successful at Short . to new batsman . the unit 5 and over it's another game . now . he's ducked that it's hit the periscope . and fallen safely . how lucky can you get completely done . over and somehow it flies into safety . again they've kept both men back down . the ground for George Bailey clip these . thoughts had on the way to to Don his . gloves but he stabbed him as well . the magic from ms dhoni . yeah you tell your lakeside catch anyway . it's just as good in that scenario . oh he's smashed that it's come from . nowhere . maxvill goes to 11 . stick or twist here he comes again it's . flat enough to stay out of the hands of . the fielder ten off the last two and . eventful over 12 runs and a wicket . now this 27 to win of 36 he's got him . merci beaucoup MA sold or shipped it . back and it took a good catch . - he judged that will . he's analyzed the boundary one bounce . and over-the-road Fortner the finisher . there he goes he launches here we go . it's it through the offside no he . doesn't hit the stops now . Siegel had to hit the stumps in give it . up batsman of giving it up said fine . league up inside the circle third man up . inside the circle through the outside . hand at his best . absolutely screamer this . you gotta find he's done it again James . thought boy he's a handy of this . guy just get your home there's neat . women hadn't have done a really good job . in that out of 21 for this last wicket . and have got a straighter over the line . and they're two from two in the series . well he's been a terrific game a . terrific chairs by Australia India of . random toss probably think that they've . been twenty or thirty short but yeah . well finished before live cricket all . summer long .

            " . starting these matches nowadays and that . process must be adhered to here we go . underway and through could be underway . with a boundary it will just run away . from you down there . at these short straight boundaries . overworked . that'll do nicely thank you very much . it's a good first over for new zealand . 12 coming from it . is like all young fast bowlers . oh that's what he does that's what gupta . will do to that ball that's . just short of the length . circle and then a very backward point as . well . they're unlikely to have a man station . there . 25 without loss . i'm going to come out swinging . oh so close and this should go for four . as well . so luck is favoring the brave right now . behind square maybe gonna bowl a bit . shorter . no he's gonna toss it up and he's gonna . get . smashed over his head for six and a big . one at that . oh chipped it chipped it . just went for four we hardly hit it . now that is control that comes out the . fingers differently . it just took three it just took a few . locks . before gupta decided to climb into it . and therefore the short ball doesn't . work either . oh he went up he went full again and he . paid the price the line was different . but it's just as good a result for gupta . real dynamo lives and maher in the world . knows that . stoinis crunch . one bounce for nearly six . this is a start and a half beautiful . oh they'll run away as well what new . zealand have done tonight . tarpon striker well as they've hit gats . they've timed it beautifully . paula monroe is looking over wide . midwicket here . about there and it's found it quite . nicely . looking and delivered that length . doesn't work so well . see that happening all the time . oh that's lucky could run away good . chase . but chrislyn bails out he's had some . injury problems that might have been a . good . goes the timing there very very good . 20 rows back half a chance there you . missed it . 107 . oh that's massive a huge strike up into . the deep midwicket region and . capital has 50. . now monroe gets it too and monroe has . 50. . unbelievably good this from new . zealand's point of view . that could have been brilliant . get your hands around that can't . just carries on richardson down on the . boundary wasn't that far from him . early on but you get that i have . capitalized . oh here's another fireworks are going . over the screen into the crowd . a . just standing it's air time not down yet . world angel tithing . i don't believe it surely not surely . this didn't go all the way . what did it got them there in the first . place . it's a length ball she's going to be . plenty more all the way . eleven always wanted this fantastic . crowd tonight just a tickle it gets to . the boundary in a flash . well this is how simon dole and the . bulldog said that new zealanders would . straight to the field of deep square . makes no mistake . this is where you've got to get players . trying to hit it to the longest . boundaries . the length . there's nobody there only the camera . crew . 14 i don't think enough bowlers go to . the yorker . soon enough . well that's just got an extraordinary . shot it's gone up in the air i thought . this will be four more perfectly placed . he is on fire tonight . down the ground again mid on comes in . he's already said he's six more . yeah this is what drives stay 88 . from 47. that is massive that is just . so high goodness me . it certainly went higher than it went . longer it's still over six . trademark from gotzel not looking once . he's hit it keeps the head down . so far up in the air glenn maxwell even . though it only went about five or six . meters . 94 . has his second t200 . on his backyard outstanding knock . martin gupta dangerous player . clean hitting of the qriket ball to all . parts of the ground . just checking that last one but was . signaled by the field in the deep but . hit the . boundary on the full which is six . confirmed there and hit firmly . oh very clever very nifty the confidence . of youth . good stuff 206 for two 16 gone . 44 runs conceded in two and a half overs . now then this could be out should be out . there's out . this time maxwell gets it right and . guptor's magnificent knock here at eden . park . comes to an end . they are on their feet and so they . should be . good response from the crowd even the . australians are getting in . congratulating what was a magnificent . performance from martin guptill . the low full toss was the delivery that . brought him undone pretty close to that . waist high as well . maxwell in the deep very . safe hands and the end of a great knock . yeah an economy rate wise ashton agar . has been the best of the australian . bowlers . wow that's out that's gone skiing . in the most unfortunate way mark chapman . has to leave the ground he's had his . helmet knocked off his head back onto . the stumps . so billy stanley does have a save . this is a dismissal you don't see very . often . quite a nasty one it would have been a . nasty blow to the head without the . helmet . but uh how often do you see that . and that decided to give it a go out . of the old days oh that's dragged on as . well beautifully bold took all the pace . out of it . and a few hiccups coming at the end . yes inside edge . this could be out as well yeah . comfortably taken ty in the date again . and pace is pulled back and again . williamson can't find the timing . yeah you're right one eighteen white . smithy again . is it over the top it is yes that is the . late momentum . and that is 50k is it i think it is got . to get it in the zone tyre you've got to . get it in the zone . it's there taylor gets it and gets it . for six to finish . how appropriate is that some vic hitting . from . shall we say the senior man and new . zealand are going to finish tonight . at 243 for six and to be fair . this crowd of 30 000 plus have hardly . sat down . through the whole 20 overs simply . amazing stuff . as well . over the top yes it is chipped but timed . from david warner 11 without loss after . one . two with 50 grand . cats on edge go all the way as well . deep over that's ridiculous . it's a thick outside . inside edge more luck everyone's a . winner . hot chocolate . cricket it's earned his way into this . australian side . this time oh my goodness me oh you feel . you feel for the bowlers surely . but he's a cracking butt this is a new . one thick inside edge stick outside . four . i was just looking to see it both of . those boundary fielders . out on the left . down diving away tim seifert pick up . four . always a chance is this it's in the air . a long time . gets that one gets it behind square . picks up four and more . 16 from that over australia off to a . flyer 43 without loss . oh another one another inside edge might . not pick up four this time . so so he stopped but no he can't just . kept running away from him . we were just saying darcy shaw . swung away will it go all the way yes it . will yes . it will you betcha . where's mitchell is he out there . high in the air and long way over long . on as well . another six for david warnup great . striking . too short too short four more adam to . the extras bumble . gotta get together new zealand getting . away australia . well he's going to have to do something . because this is just becoming . a riot here . five men inside the circle on the off . side . saudi gets hit straight for six . just a chip just the chip . that's extraordinary let that guy's fuse . now then that is massive again huge . top deck west stand no doubt there . six anywhere 91. . that has hit so hard so hard . tour delivery and australia have a . hundred already . david warner has 50 off just 20 balls . and he isn't finished yet . through the middle has been new . zealand's weapon . that's a bad delivery and it costs it . again . just being pressured into bowling . mistakes . that's the wicked new zealand needed . and it was the google david warner going . on the back foot to try and hit it away . to the onside . and misses it completely maybe just a . lack of pace off the . surface and straight through the end of . a fine innings from the skipper . 24 for one . now that's is up and over and it didn't . look to be that well timed . solely down the ground this will test it . on and off and they get nowhere near it . went like a tracer bullet i know you . used to be crowds but what do you think . of the atmosphere here . oh look it's absolutely amazing you know . you talk to a few of the rugby union . boys that play here all the time . there's a look at that dave . unfortunately what we'll do is we'll . head upstairs but we'll see all the very . best thanks man . that takes it as martin gupta yeah look . he blows the raspberry out there . almost death like in the approach there . this time he goes land and he gets . smashed for the onside . oh it's as easy and as simple as you . like . look out in hospitality it's coming your . way . i just hardly missed the blockhole but . that's all it takes today . another one high into the stance . see he's trying to vote full and . straight or full but he's missing goes . short again that's risky really risky . yeah . and it's four more 162 for two . string of wickets when no one could find . the middle of the fence his wheeler . and there goes wheeler it's not . wheeler's night . i was just going to say ben wheeler . coming back for his third over . having another guy . and again over the offside this is in . the gap too does it go all the way . not quite he's come back he's pulled two . balls here wheel . to play the little little scoop shot . now he goes short the slower ball and . that is some brilliant batting that is . some . outstanding play . well just clear thought but the task at . hand that they should be . tremendously confident . and that helps that was just a long hot . though . and he just picked the spot and smashed . it . punched down the ground dead straight . yes another boundary they are making a . mockery of this . quill . they got him maybe a bit of bottom edge . involved . max was furious with himself it was on . for him to close the deal as he did the . other night not tonight though . oh that's too high i think yeah it's . been called no ball . so there's going to be a free hit that . is the worst possible result from new . zealand's point of view . oh this got away as well . the bowlers get the yips uh . yeah we do we do hurricanes apologize to . all hurricanes fans . straight up tim seifert be the man . you are so using bolt has worked . is there a late charge coming . that is huge for new zealand . bolt's the man . beautiful shot wouldn't that be a ball . but the way he worked it down the fine . leg . was superb so that's a huge australia . not possible . not now maybe one of the most eventful . overs you'll ever see has finally come . to an end . 25 for one it produced absolutely . chocolate sedan park . sunday night . beautifully done against the angle . coming into him . that is superb and very clever . goodness me how big is that . and that is that as they say . that is that the catch that means . absolutely nothing to that bloke except . he should hold on to the ball and put in . his pocket . but the fact of the matter is this that . massive hit from aaron finch has put a . full stop . on a world record run chase by australia . and can you believe it they have seven . balls to spare seven balls to spare . that's extraordinary\n",
            " . was ballistic Ryan what about Chris . Gayle na is also got to step up to the . plate but we've got Paul sterling who . was brilliant . Praveen tombe starts off with a wide and . probably four White's the presence of . Chris Gayle making him ball that line . just trying to keep that ball on that . middle and legs jump and it lot will . toss catch it as the colleague could be . all over for Chris Gayle it is not . finding the middle of the bat and he's . gone Chris Gayle they were just sighs . must have said sigh of disappointment . here . of course when Morgan is in the skipper . at number three we'll toss will you get . another response it said great response . it picks up another wicked over Pluto's . gold . yeah that's what I'm organ sinking too . low full toss just below the waist . Morgan straight get four or six . no you won't the sheriff up makes an . early appearance look at the strike red . wonderful strike rate 400 are with got . powerhouses with full toss brilliant . I mean picking up four wickets off . football 47 year-old doing the job . getting through the defenses hitting the . timber and the wood and everything else . talk about ripping his shorts six four . three . it's a drink maybe this guy ever too big . of a Patrick at 42nd and what a bizarre . way together the fool just ran in here . you nice are getting canopy incredible . Sun I'm gasping for breath Ian we've . seen ball fly all over for fours and . sixes and suddenly you get certainly a . dream run for the 47 year old well I . just refer everybody there watch the top . moody . tees but he's knocked over guys with . yorkers very wayne panel is in 12 for . five incredible night for tom be . brilliant . that's first runs that is considered off . the bat that is beautifully struck . through the offside wayne park where a . shine seems a shock this is net . lovely cricket stroke Wayne far now . catid is the call it goes over the head . of the mid off bender another for strong . hit down the ground this time I only . just got enough on the swine far now cuz . it's skidding on as he just saying there . cuttings at all man it's cleared him . comfortably but yeah not that much in it . it's it up in the air a brilliant catch . really is a fantastic running catch it's . off the turf is Paul sterling was gone . wonderful piece of that elitism and it's . very best floating more and more here . and now the Knights of 21 for six when . Knights are having a horror sure here . I just knew what he had to offer both on . and off the field as a good how hard is . it to Don things around for it for your . team you know when their first game yeah . look we lost horribly but the end of the . day it's just one game in the tournament . and it's important that we still remain . positive and with clear minds they don't . need a coach jumping down the 27 for the . loss of six that's a high full toss . close to a hundred I can't with that put . an air hostess on it it's over the roof . he's a strong striker airborne add some . serious air miles on it yeah he loved it . as well just a shimmy and off . do 130 I was talking about it was who . runs away outside edge and I won't chase . it down there's some good fortune that's . the 50-50 for six you know they have got . the old rounders in you you always want . to have your one of your regular batsmen . out there throughout the 10 overs if you . want to really sleep oh yeah that's a . good strike please got all of that he's . got the big blind and a big hit you for . a six every time you bought that Blin . this was a quicker delivery easy for him . to just get under it . and swing that back bliss always going . another one that's gone for six . back-to-back six . just gonna have a look and see if it . goes it sit on the floor does it seeks . it's two in a row . this isn't it away Oh is he going out of . it I think he has just it's a big iover . 23 from it so it's exactly what they . need a trio bits remaining then out 69 . 4-6 the Pepsi catch an eight-course . Saturday you'll see a lot of people . coming especially in the evening when . the lights are on mixed up cutting out . of the keeper and another week it'll . fall and that was headless ran and the . non-striker did not want to go wonder . whether he was ball watching yeah I . think he was just looking at the ball . and looking at if the field is gonna . miss it or not and did not hear the fall . from the striker the news easy runs a . big opportunity to finish it off and . needle a lot of these players playing . this format nicely played good deft . touch flick all the way . then we gotta catch the one that's going . into the crowd and she kept so it looks . like they're gonna surpass that it'll . look like it for a while don't handle . Parnell it's a little flick using the . pace beautifully and it went a long way . oh yeah well that's smart that's what . you're talking about that's the slow . ball again and moved on its way and . danced away because it deserves a good . dancing . yeah very even final ball that's a good . shot that is a really good shot . that's like Shahzad yesterday . and now they're 92 for seven moaning . there it goes that'll be a boundary 98 . they're close to a hundred what a . recovery this has been by the Knights . has changed and they've changed it with . their lower order to bear delivery from . Cuddy yeah he's looking for that your . coat but yeah what a wonderful look come . back you know thanks too piggish score . having been five to twelve well yes well . played and what a finish . the Knights have recovered 103 for seven . yeah that was 59 for one being in the . mine the sevens we could fill 70 100 3 4 . 7 and look 23 from 14 and the . partnerships down the bottom got them . there then we're in Parnell first and . bowling was superb . there's a matter hog-eye me get yourself . in the game in the field first ball . you've got a tight . Cyndi's versus Kerala nights live from . Sharjah cricket stadium bill hanging in . there and then Wayne Parnell with a . brilliant in instance . lutely is it like him I I think he's an . unusual style play hits in areas that . are not common and therefore he's . finding gaps often as the wicked till we . could just leaked four runs right who . have we got Tom Curran coming on to ball . yeah and he was expensive yesterday so . he's got to try and find the ocean it's . a smash and six be easily done by depth . which he was quite expensive in . particular one of his overs yesterday . because of the lengthy bowls and if . you've got the leverage and that ability . that Dipsy chairs as most of these . batsmen do it's just a natural strike . it's another head down the ground couple . of bounces and into the fence we talked . for fours and sixes well the reason I . say I think they play Tambe smartly is I . think because he's such a wise . campaigner and he can't get him away too . often he's almost the guy were you . trying not overs and then you start to . look at the damage at the other guys . Karen went for the thirty from his two . overs yesterday and the first one went . for twenty-one and straightaway . look at this Rama's picked up by . deficits he made it look so easy . I Randy yeah just stayed where he was . and use the pace and ball boy they're . taking a very good catch . yeah there's acreage of open area that . you just think of last night after the . game . Karen would have been thinking right . what did I do wrong that over that went . for 2009 play the shots or such a . glorious straight drive from Shane . Watson 25 from the over it's a massive . overhaul the Cyndi's 29 without a wicked . tea without a wicked in 2.2 well that's . how you play a t10 you've got to go for . it and you take a band or any which way . through the legs French cat as they say . in fact behind that back leg dip . stitches on strike glares the front leg . and hits it sweetly into the gap what a . good shot down at a time with even . though it's Cpl and he's a lovely chap . as well talks it simply talks himself . down he said I've just to slaughter I . just get out there I just don't swing . the bat that's gone that's lap four six . pick the wrong on and hit it across the . line against us bend dips it . there's magnificent tonight . and how much uh can you be thinking . about the wrong end of the left hand . like he got the stumping yesterday that . it was the length covers the thumbs and . well Paul are there is so good with . these caches the one hand me over steps . and then the free hit . it's smash for six surge ask it's over . the rope but all the same it is cost . plenty cost plenty now they moved to . fifty seven hits it hard why not shot . that is he's brilliant he's brilliant . and he has to be an opener they got it . wrong in the West Indies he has to bat . at the top . you think if it's t20 he's got six overs . a pair play where it blow there he goes . slicing it past the feeling for for . Shane Watson because it turned out to be . a no ball it's been downhill ever since . that moment for North a free hit went . for six deficits then took a liking and . hit him hard four fours and then no i oh . that's a half it that do very nicely for . Shane Watson it's a big six . absolutely brilliant with that straight . shot well that's what I love about him . he keeps it simple that's wise so . consistent because it goes down the . ground oh that's a big one that's done . the distance and how almost hits the . roof he I he loved it as well made a . great sound . if it got from here on in the air . someone's gonna catch that it's . comfortable it's did such that has to go . cheeky little googly from lemak Charney . yeah wanted to go big didn't get all of . it that's gonna stone with useful . numbers mind if it was down the line . that's down the line that's over the . line over the line . Watson's not gonna miss our this swell . set now is playing really well that's . his third six off the inning is he gone . with the ah that's even better it's a . little flick such control here from . Watson well fancy catch a crook . very similar action replay stroke this . one he timed it even better those in the . crowd nobody giving it giving it a try . to catch that maybe it did got a hand . now let's just go on the other side now . sees Shane Watson been through the . onside time to go through they're loving . it . well that's a convincing win then good . thing B is on he battered well in the . last game the pause level very . comfortable victory in the end and . rightly so to the cinders and the Camden . sees it all the way through with a half . century little reading care we go over . these red outfits Shane Watson marvelous . performance after that deficits played . extremely well and the captain himself . the skipper Shane Watson got this is . this date belongs to the bowlers we have . seen a couple of head tricks and end . table ever Tommy was outstanding picking . up but not only five acres but major . Ricketts the the veteran leg spinner . absolutely tremendous and pan out and . the partnership of 103 5 for 15 with 10 . dots that has just obscene and T 10 . units horrible start they got and in the . endeavor said she just missed out on an . opening stand of a she was the only . wicked for her young son deep picking up . his wicked for 14 and it was pretty easy . for the Cindy's to get that turtle . Honduran Pope one of mana the match to . Praveen tombe for his five wickets . including a Hetrick for maximum sixes . and it's shared man white . Wayne Parnell and Anton DIF such and . Shane Watson to be let's not fight over . this boys and it's for stylish player . goes to entrant deficit . 49 of 20 balls wonderful hitting from . the left-hander H of the match and it . goes to David Malan for taking that . wonderful cash to dismiss Paul sterling . you\n",
            " . we are at the green park here in Kanpur . we've been here many times as players . before but today it feels a little . special because this is now the venue . for the 500 Test match for Indian . cricket which is quite an achievement . Ravi Shastri is here with me just four . nations have managed to play 500 Test . matches that's a large number and Indian . cricket should be really proud of this . fact absolutely because it's a long . journey started in 1932 so you know you . know they played all these years they've . sustained the interest of the people you . know Test matches were hard to come by . you know in the early years but you know . what's what we are seeing today is . fabulous you know and we are at a . heritage ground this is one of the . oldest grounds in Indian cricket when . India had its first original when you . scan pool was one of them yes so you . know it's it's amazing how history just . writes his own script India played its . first Test match in 1932 the hundredth . Test match Mansur Ali Khan patottie was . the captain happened in 1967 35 long . years to play their first hundred Test . matches and and again tribute there you . know to the Board of Control for Cricket . in India to sustain the interest you . know to invite teams from overseas . invite the right teams you know it would . cost money you know they would want . retainers they would want bank . guarantees in advance but by calling . those teams like the West Indies the . Australians you know when New Zealand . when they were strong you sustained the . interest of the public you know and what . you did was ensured that the Indian team . got good competition and became stronger . decade by decade we are talking Test . match forget but you a part of that 1983 . World Cup winning squad the response the . reaction there was a lot of adulation . fanfare but not too many financial . rewards I mean that is a big change when . India wins now there's also financial . rewards with it no but that was the one . single moment you know that redefine the . way people looked at cricket in this . country as a sport you know parents . wanted young kids to play the game your . corporate houses came behind backing the . sport like never before . you know the sudden interest or the . just the way the cricketer was looked at . by the armed junta by the the corporate . crowd you know by the blue collar was . totally different and India started . playing well you know they they enjoyed . that attention they got you know they . the performance is short you won the . World Championship after that you know . you again staged the World Cup in India . where we lost in the semi-finals but you . had a sequence of good performances you . know which when television came into . India exploded and that's why today like . I said to you earlier it's a small scale . industry you mentioned it's a billion . dollars porneia yeah it's a fact it's a . billion dollar small scale industry is . settled it yeah so much has change over . the years you were being part of this . whole chain this long journey as a . player as a broadcaster you've also had . held responsible positions within the . cricket team as well if you look at . Indian cricket say maybe in the 70s 80s . and now 2016 what is the big change you . see with the brand of cricket that India . is played . I think fabulous it's like I say they're . the back Piper's of world cricket . wherever they go you get huge audiences . and obviously that has to reflect on . some of the great players who played in . that time you know the fact that they've . handed on the baton to a good young . generation who play attractive cricket . and let's not forget you know it's . evolved the game has evolved perfectly . from India's point of view you know you . have Test cricket then you have 50 over . cricket and then you have twenty20 . instant cricket you know which I think . the game needs all three formats . you know Test cricket will benefit . because if the money that's made out of . 50 over cricket and 2000 cricket is . channeled back into the system at . grassroot level you keep having a strong . test team for your stew I'm glad you . brought that topic on because this is . not just about raving about Indian . cricket this is also a time when you of . course there's a cause for celebration . 500 test magic this match is a big deal . so you celebrate that landmark but . there's also a matter of concern with . regards to Test match cricket some . efforts are being made to make . Test cricket viable bringing the . audience's people at home as well you . know the that number can go bigger how . do you think that that can happen and is . it possible at all with the changing . tastes of the modern audience it is . possible if there is good competition . you know if there's good competition it . is very possible also I think you don't . need to tweak it because luckily cricket . has three formats you know you have . games like football baseball they . haven't changed . barring one or two rules nothing has . changed in over 100 years . so you don't want to tweak it too much . to confuse the common man you have three . formats so leave Test cricket as it is . for God's sake leave the ball the same . red color only reason why that is being . attempted Ravi's to ensure that you play . at a time when people are not working . yeah because when they are at work it's . not possible even if they like Test . match cricket to watch it and I think . that is the reason why they are doing it . Tampa by all means but you know I would . rather have a session under that's the . point you made earlier a session under . light maybe three hours under lights . which means you start not little late it . start at 1:00 o'clock or 12:30 make sure . the game gets over by 8:00 8:30 so . people can go back home but the . different thing you give them you don't . have to change anything too much you . know both sides know they will have to . back one session with a red ball and the . lights wickets might fall runs might be . scored anything can happen but the rules . stay for both sides it's how you adjust . adjust ended up as long as it's not . dangerous I don't think it's dangerous . with lights here today and that could . suddenly start getting in more people . you know attractor you know make it more . attractive for the television audience . so as well you know these are the things . you want to try and think but without . trying to tweak it too much now these . obviously are long-term challenges that . I'm sure the world cricket is aware of . it they look at this as one of the goals . to achieve the challenge for . Indian cricket and the BCCI is what's . happening in the courts the court orders . the low-doc Commission their . recommendations so it's a it's a huge . deal . Indian cricketer . you know have to tackle a lot of these . recommendations which they find are . unfair and might stifle the growth of . Indian cricket some feel that Indian . cricket will not be able to stand on its . feet if all these recommendations were . put into place what are your views on . that see I didn't get a chance to speak . to the loader committee right but they . are X Supreme Court judges and they have . got experience you know so obviously . they've gone through a lot of stuff . they've spoken to a lot of people and . come up with a lot of recommendations . now when it comes to governance when it . comes to administration you know where . if they felt that things weren't going . well they've got every right to mention . what can be done the same with . governance another brief that they had . been given was to sort out the fixing . problem you know how do you sort it you . know there has to be it cannot be a bill . has to be passed it you know you should . know what has to be done where a guy is . punished in such a fashion that it . deters other players from doing it it . which means a recommendation to . Parliament to pass a bill you know which . can put a guy in the clink so that no . one else will want to do it again fine . but there are certain areas we know . where I thought that you can still have . a dialogue with the loader committee . because those are things if applied it . could take the game back it will be tend . to become like for example the . cooling-off period yeah okay why would I . want to join the bc's here why would any . player want to join the BCC if I have an . idea that is something constructive that . I can do contribute in three years . you're telling me to go but what can . anyone achieve in three years he gets to . come back but the cooling cooling off . although I know the guy and after me is . competent enough if I have done a . competent job I should be respected for . my competency and where I think six . years is no harm after that if you have . to sit out for three years come back for . another six fair enough but six years is . enough time even the presidential . candidate of the country it's a . five-year term hmm you know unless . something happens and there's an . election in between he stays for five . years . you know and that's anywhere in the . world yeah any other recommendation that . you're eating I thought the selectors . that you know three when I played the . game I thought three selectors was . enough but today the way the game has . evolved with the three formats of the . game the interest that exists in the . country the combined number of people . that play the game in India is more than . the population of all the countries that . play cricket together . so if Australia has three selector . that's fine it's 20 million people 17 . million people here you have 1.2 billion . I mean you're asking that poor guy too . much you know he'll get serious travel . miles yeah you know if he is one of the . three will go from one end to the other . of the country and still not be able to . do a job I think five is still in order . and another thing you know I've always . believed there's no substitute for . experience hmm you know we say that in . cricket . this is something I've learned from the . sport it's something I've learned when . I've interacted with people from . different you know different fields in . life whether its corporate whether it's . sport whether its administration you . name it and I certainly believe in what . I am saying there's no substitute for . experience and we've got a couple of . guys in the board you know they're 70 . plus but they'll forget a youngster . they'll give anyone from any field a run . for their money you know I'm not . targeting anyone or anything because . I've I've seen them work yep . I've seen them as administrations I . don't to single out or take names I've . seen them working people know who I'm . talking about . because I don't mince words in any way . but they are outstanding so you know and . these things if you try and push it . immediately it might just be detrimental . at this moment of time so if you have to . make a final sort of assessment and . roundup of the load ah recommend your . dialogue but still continue you know for . all of you think it's a bit under it . shouldn't be like a boxing bout I think . there has to be some you know where . genuine effort should be made you know . ideally from both parties to have a . dialogue on certain things which you . know can work most of the . recommendations are anywhere accepted . and the board is trying to do something . but you know this . this tree cooling period is harsh and . also if you want cricketers to come into . the system spell out this is a . professional job look wicked I will want . to do a non read job yeah it's a . professional job you know you you played . cricket for six hours in your time you . know at times when you see what people . get today you got peanuts you know but . then if you pay peanuts you get monkeys . so get get professional professional . will write the right number on the money . what should be given for this job that . job whatever comes their way make it . professional you see a lot of cricketers . coming into the system well thank you so . much Rabia for talking really . passionately about this it's a very . sensitive topic but I've been very . amazing I'm passionate Sanjay is because . it's a great cricket playing country it . is and if things were that bad you won't . have achieved what you have achieved . we're celebrating five hundred Test . match you won two World Cups you're . number one team in the world . so all cannot be wrong yes there might . have been areas which you know you . needed a whack on the backside to be . corrected you know but could that be the . reason why some feel it's a bit extreme . I won't say extreme dialogue I'm saying . dialogue you know a dialogue because . let's be practical if it can work or not . work you know because we want Indian . cricket to carry on we don't want it to . go back five years you don't want this . team to suffer five years you'll have . they'll be total chaos . other teams get the upper hand and then . again you have to try and climb up the . ladder dividing to be fair let's say . let's get back to what is really . important which is you know cricket on . the field and as I said 500 tests might . on this venue it said okay we've all . been tests we get fans it's the ultimate . test for a cricketer 500 Test match we . are celebrating that today thousand Test . match for India possible or you'll test . cricket my struggle to read the or it . can happen as easily as the last sort of . 300 matches have happened see I'll tell . you you know it's again personalities I . believe who make the sport we had one . gentleman yesterday who played 40 . percent yeah okay . inspire generation after generation when . he played the game and there were . another little fellow before him . exactly and before that the spinner see . every era has superstars but when you . have someone like a Tendulkar who played . across two and a half generations and . where everyone in this team literally . worships you know suddenly from this . team if you get an individual you know . barracks already outstanding you get two . three more individuals who carry on that . the good job that was done by the . players earlier exactly what Kapil Dev . said the other day and he's a legend the . law is to take a number of people caps . you know really write inspired so that . will make people ten years down the line . twenty years down the line wanting to . play Test match cricket and twenty years . down the line no be whole you might be . 1,000 and 1,200 you're talking about . peanuts you pay peanuts you get monkeys . maybe Test match cricket remuneration . also could get a limit I am as high as . the highest between I so plus or maybe . t20 cricket fifty where I put into Test . cricket finance and said Robert thank . you so much stuff there's always fresh . rock and it was a sensitive topic that . came in between but I'm - nice of you to . address I didn't get a chance to speak . to the panel but since you asked me the . question I told ya you were directing . the team now say your back man I didn't . have that I meant yeah and the open . conflict of interest don't do anything . then thank you very much thanks for the . stretcher well that's it from us\n",

India Pakistan matches neighbor over 160 . did you think you've done well to . restrict India well of course they have . a strong batting lineup and restrict . them in 157 and that that were our plan . to we have to stick with 160 and we done . it but unfortunately our betting line of . doesn't go through so that's why we lost . the game but they're the way they're . bowling the bowling superb what went . wrong was it poor short selection or . tension pressure that one I don't think . so that was one pressure but we had a . few bad shots . that's why we'll lose that game you've . enjoyed this twenty20 tournament you . should feel proud because Pakistan . played could forget to reach the final . of course the way they're playing our . guys it's so probably and inshallah . we're gonna off straight after that we . have series against South Africa and we . looking forward to it and inshallah we . working hard again . tough luck sure but better luck next . time thank you sure Malik the captain of . the Pakistan team well now the man of . the match award for an outstanding . bowling performance today in the middle . of the innings and to take three . important middle wickets for Pakistan . for India alpha and Pathan for a spell . of three for 16 . they found will collect the man of the . match award excellent figures . well it found outstanding performance . you'll be delighted because when you . came in to ball you were under a bit of . pressure now martial arts it's a great . feeling . we come back from my side and obviously . being the world cup it's amazing and . obviously when I came I was a bit of I . was in under a bit of pressure but bowl . full my nerves and boolean ideas we saw . you mixing your pace a lot a lot of . slower deliveries what was a pitch light . was a ball coming on to the bat or was . it a little slower than the normal . Johannesburg pitch which was a bit on . the slow side I was holding a bet when I . will expect the split-finger slow ones . but so that's why I had to active go a . little slower because obviously back . when we're going after the gulen yeah . now they needed more than a transfer . over so this was trying to just make . some space in between just try to get . given a quick one as well okay and what . was going through the player's mind when . those final over started pressure . obviously was a it could have gone . anywhere like miss ball haka was playing . pretty well but I think joking the ball . really were are really well and picked . up all the ball is not only joking the . whole the bonus did really well tour . through other term and RP all the other . bonus as well sheesh on that they old . but he they all ball pretty well we . played as a team we feel that really . well we better really well and I think . this dessert especially what happened . after the World Cup . well done it fun go well thank you it . found put on man of the match in this . 2025 . the next the player of the tournament . the player who's been the most . consistent in the tournament and that . man is shahid afridi of pakistan runs . over the bat wickets with the ball child . if you can come up and collect the award . from a Sri Molly player of the . tournament . well shiet many congratulations you'll . be disappointed you couldn't pull it off . today first of all I want to thanks . mighty Allah winning illusion doesn't . matter but we guys played really good . cricket energy I want to give . congratulation to Indian captain and all . the Indian nations now tough situation . today when you came on to bat and you'll . be disappointed with the short who play . but that's a natural game isn't it I'm . already struggling with no betting I . really focused on my balling and . fiddling as well but yeah and I want to . mention one more thing because before . this I coming then this event friend of . mine said him so he said you will be the . man of the series so this is for him . thank you so much and how have you . enjoyed this twenty20 format the crowds . have been brilliant atmosphere fantastic . oh it's a great fun and we all enjoy it . is a good entertainment that I think ICC . need after every two years they go for a . World Cup better luck next time share . well the Indian team now will have to . come up and collect their medallions in . alphabetical order Ajith a Gurkha . Pierce Charla Gotham gamble Dinesh . Karthik - Putin Yusuf Patan the render . server . Joginder Sharma Rohit Sharma Harbhajan . Singh RP Singh Yuvraj Singh Swisher . and Robin Uthappa and of course the . captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who will . just connect the Madeira name . furthermore . so the Indian players just collecting . their medallions enjoy if you can come . up please . many congratulations how does it feel . and I think it's one of the things that . I've achieved in the last three at one . of the things I treasure for the whole . life in the rest of my life and I think . it's really amazing I'm really excited . and I would like to congratulate the . boys over there and likely thanks them . for the effort and for the response that . they have given me I think it was really . amazing the young side event we came to . the tournament no one expected us to win . and the way we have won the final match . I think we deserve a big celebration . Pakistan did extremely well to restrict . you to 160 and they played good figure . as well I think the ball very well you . know it the wicket was not really doing . too much but I think from the 12th or . onwards the way good and Arafat Bowl I . think that was really really really . excellent but we knew one thing we . scored 150 or 160 still they have to . score it and we always know the run rate . it's always always over six so if you . get quick quick wickets and later on if . I can pressurize the bats when it gets . really hard now what was happening in . those final two overs there must have . been a lot of thoughts going through . your mind choking the sharma Harbhajan . Singh Joginder Sharma Harbhajan Singh . what made you give Joginder that last . over I think but he was 100 wasn't sure . and I was not getting the yorkers right . so I felt you know instead of giving up . bowler was not hundred percent sure I . should give a bowler who wants to do . well at that international never even if . I if we would have lost the match it . doesn't matter to me but I think the way . Jogi Bowl it was really good . now what does this be to you this you . know what would you think this would do . for Indian to do well one thing for sure . the 2020 version will catch up in India . the excitement and the type of game it . is I think it will be a big hit in India . apart from that I think now after we . lost after the way we departed from the . World Cup initially you know in 2007 I . think it will do it will do the repair . work for some time and we have to keep . keep doing it in Australian series . followed by Pakistan then we are off to . Australia so we have to do consistently . well now before you go here this out the . BCCI has announced an award of two . million dollars for the Indian team . and a core of repairs for your rats in . for hitting his six sixes in an oval na . manja you can go up and collect the big . one the world twenty20 Champions India . and when the same Tony gets the award . from mr. Ramani where the fireworks have . started here it's time for the Indian . team to look it's been an outstanding . performance and these are scenes have . been watched by millions around the . world there will be fireworks with India . for sure but at the end of it all it's . been a magnificent tournament . beautifully organized and like I . mentioned at the start a massive massive . success India the world TT champions . pictures that they would savor for a . very long time to come young man with . ambition in their heart and they arrived . there with no one expecting them to win . and they've gone on to win the first . edition of crickets youngest child . they'll pump their fists and they'll let . that dreams fly today it was an . absolutely fantastic moment two young . teams two unheralded teams have given . this ICC World twenty20 the best . advertisement it could have could have . ever got this was this was absolutely . fantastic - Nguni the young man will . embrace each other all night these are . moments you cherish if you're near a . sportsman you want to live trophies you . want the world to watch you wanna have . little memories that you're gonna keep . by with you and these are fantastic . memories books really gospel drum is . Raja know what it is to have lifted the . World Cup and I'm sure you know what . they're going through just now oh yes I . know I think it's just gonna be you know . for us for starters they'll just be . screaming they won't be saying anything . they'll just be saying here whatever it . is and that's it they will be doing . nothing else excepting screaming and by . the time they get back to the dressing . room they'll be exhausted by all the . screaming and then they'll start and . have a bit of champagne to to you know . to get rid of the past and dry throats . and then after the champagne is sunk in . after a couple of glasses of champagne . or something then they won't remember . what they do they go I think they'll . start screaming again clouds have been . fantastic as well it's been a very . well-supported tournament this the ICC . World twenty20 as Robbie said in the . presentation very well-organized . tournament all of us who enjoyed being . here and at last we got a final to . remember when you've been through so . many finals that have turned out to be . anticlimax isn't your class got a final . backrooms the tournament deserve oh . absolutely I think coming so close by . for that football for the finals was . just the right kind of finals that you . would want because really it was it was . a very very close again that's the kind . of game that you want to wonder what I . think this victory certainly will help . mind us in Dhoni to become a better . leader because he's been fantastic . Travis t20 competition but I think it'll . lift him as a leader because he did have . the stars with him we had a young team . and to win a world away but just been . fantastic . yes they'll be enjoying that as well . he's built with this chapter India . anthem is virtually being an ambassador . so that's the way it's looking at the . moment India that crowd winners of the . first ICC was 2020 and as the . celebrations continue we'll take a . little break back in just a normal . enjoyed yourself to\n",

            " . a wise person once told me . dreams don't work . unless you do . we're trying so hard . in our lives to fit in we try to fit . into certain groups certain threats . certain sororities you know among . certain friends . yet the people we idolize are most are . the ones that stand out but when you're . prepared . there is no fear there is no fear of . failure because even if you've walked . out of something and you feel like you . failed at it . your preparation is so strong . that you're gonna take that failure and . turn it into the outcome you desire . and most people stop at failure okay . we've all failed at things . i'm going to continue to fail at stuff . right . it's the most powerful tool you can use . but it all depends on how you use it . what would your future be like . if you decided to to want that which you . desire so strongly . that it prepares you past your fears . that you experience the fear as the one . book says feel the fear and do it anyway . life is 10 percent what happens to you . it's 90 what you do about it no matter . who you are no matter where you are in . life you can take the lid off of your . jaw and and if . if you're wondering if you still have . the lid on in your life here are some . clues that's going to let you know that . the lid is still on if you're not . excited about waking up in the morning . if you're sitting around bored out of . your mind . if you got time to do everything anybody . asks you to do . you probably got the lid on . if when you tell your dreams to all your . friends it makes sense to them . you got your lead on man your dreams . should be should not make sense to . everybody you got to say something to . make people go how you going to do that . that's when you got the lid off and if i . were you i'd do that i take the lid off . makes sense to me . they're always going to get ready to get . set to get going what we've got to do is . boom just like that move into action . every time you remember your dream . you're removing some dirt you're digging . it back out . the true mark of a champion is even . though some dirt gets thrown on your . dream instead of letting it get buried . you keep shaking it off you keep moving . forward you keep looking for a new . opportunity . you wouldn't be having that opposition . if you didn't have something great in . you . if your dream wasn't alive and on track . right on schedule to come to pass you . wouldn't have so many things coming . against you . that dream is still alive . you may have tried a year ago . five years ago or 40 years ago . didn't work out . nobody was there to help you . go back and try again . this is your time . this is your moment . your destiny is calling out to you can i . tell you . your dream is not dead . it's just not in season . your time is coming promotion is coming . good breaks are coming promises you've . been standing on . dreams you've been praying about . lack is not your destiny . constantly struggling barely getting by . is not the end of your story . these light afflictions are for a moment . the adversity is temporary the glory is . eternal . lord i believe this is my year . to get healthy and hope . this is my year to meet the people of my . dreams this is my year to go further in . my career to step into a new level of my . destiny . this is my year to accomplish dreams . to break free from this depression this . is my year to meet the right people this . is my year to get healthy and whole this . is your year to see double this is your . year for vindication for restoration for . new beginnings now get your mind going . in the right direction . here's the secret . the people that do the most with their . lives the people that seem . the most self-assured the ones that seem . to embody confidence the ones that seem . to define . confidence . they're the ones that had to face down . the most fear they simply didn't linger . in it don't hate your competitors . respect your competitors . learn from him . i had a very important person my life . come to me and say who's your hero and i . said i don't know i gotta think about . that give me a couple of weeks . i said i thought about it you know who . it is i said it's me in 10 years . so i turned 25 10 years later that same . person comes being though so are you a . hero and i was like . not even close . she said why is it because my hero is me . at 35 so you see every day every week . every month and every year in my life my . hero's always 10 years away i'm never . going to be a hero i'm not going to . obtain that i know i'm not that's just . fine with me because that keeps me with . somebody to keep on chase . that's the thing success and failure are . generally . slow processes . either slowly building things up . or gradually . tearing them down . and . that's why i say you've got to pay . attention . you have to . watch you have to watch . every single second . choose love . and don't ever let fear turn you against . your playful heart i believe in . manifestation i believe in . putting a rocket of desire out into the . universe and . and you get it when you believe it you . get it when you believe you have it and . that's the key so we want to get really . sensitized acutely sensitized sensory . acuity to whether what we're doing is . working or not and by the way sensory . acuity is really the measure of a . person's intelligence . what i mean by that is how do we measure . intelligence . intelligence is a measure of the number . and quality of distinctions you have in . a given situation . you can handle this you just haven't . figured it out yet it's all right this . is your training period this is the . tuition you have to pay for what you . don't know . you can do this other people have done . it doesn't take an einstein . get you some people that can teach you . some stuff that you don't know get you . some people that have done it . successfully and learn from them take . some seminars workshops read some books . on how to manage a business . change the way you see yourself and . begin to tend to the personal details . understand that nobody's going to take . care of your business better than you . you will notice the most successful . people in any field they are usually the . ones who have failed more than anybody . else you see the difference between a . successful person and everyone else it's . not a lack of strength it's not a lack . of knowledge it's a lack of will . you must experience what this life is . totally isn't it . before you go . you must experience this if you do . experience that . then such questions will never arise in . your mind because . that's not the way existing things . it's up to you in a world where we're . taught to look outside for answers for a . job that will make us happy for money . that will make us happy that answer is . within we already have it . we already have the answer but will we . unleash it will we give it will we own . it will we truly reinvent ourselves to . become the people that were capable of . becoming . the bow too tightly strung as easily . broken says one of the problems . balance is a gorgeous thing . so . be monomaniacal in your execution around . your high value targets your hvts . your mission plan . but also build in some rewards and . that's going to send a gorgeous message . to your conscious and your subconscious . mind that hey this daily practice of . execution around my deliverables is a . beautiful thing and you create this . thing called momentum and the monk who . sold his ferrari i went back and i saw . this recently i think there's a whole . chapter on momentum and you become like . this i love skiing you start off small . but as you go down the slope you pick up . momentum a lot of people say robin where . do i start i want to start a new . business i want to become a better . artist i want to find the love of my . life i want to be a world-class creative . i want to . multiply my financial life where do i . start you just start . you just start there's great power in . the start . and when you start . life starts supporting . well god wants us all to be courageous . because he knows we'll face times in . life and situations and circumstances . that it takes more than just the desire . takes courage . many people operate on the basis of fear . on the basis of what other people think . we as believers should operate on the . basis of courage courage to say no and . we ought to say no courage to say yes . when we should say yes . so what kind of courage do you have is . your sort of floating between depending . on the situation . or do you know the difference between . right and wrong for your life . and you've made up your mind . you\n",
            " . today i want to tell you three stories . from my life . that's it no big deal . just three stories . the first story . is about connecting the dots . i dropped out of reed college after the . first six months but then stayed around . as a drop in for another 18 months or so . before i really quit . so why'd i drop out . it started before i was born . biological mother was a young unwed . graduate student and she decided to put . me up for adoption . she felt very strongly that i should be . adopted by college graduates so . everything was all set for me to be . adopted at birth by a lawyer and his . wife . except that when i popped out they . decided at the last minute that they . really wanted a girl . so my parents who were on a waiting list . got a call in the middle of the night . asking . we've got an unexpected baby boy do you . want him . they said of course . my biological mother found out later . that my mother had never graduated from . college and that my father had never . graduated from high school . she refused to sign the final adoption . papers . she only relented a few months later . when my parents promised that i would go . to college . this was the start . in my life . and seventeen years later i did go to . college . but i naively chose a college that was . almost as expensive as stanford . and all of my working class parents . savings were being spent on my college . tuition . after six months i couldn't see the . value in it . i had no idea what i wanted to do with . my life . and no idea how college was going to . help me figure it out . and here i was spending all the money my . parents had saved their entire life . so i decided to drop out and trust that . it would all work out okay . it was pretty scary at the time but . looking back it was one of the best . decisions i ever made . the minute i dropped out . i could stop taking the required classes . that didn't interest me . and begin dropping in on the ones that . looked far more interesting . it wasn't all romantic . i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on . the floor in friends rooms . i returned coke bottles for the five . cent deposits to buy food with . and i would walk the seven miles across . town every sunday night . to get one good meal a week at the hari . krishna temple i loved it . and much of what i stumbled into by . following my curiosity and intuition . turned out to be priceless later on . let me give you one example . reed college at that time offered . perhaps the best calligraphy instruction . in the country . throughout the campus every poster every . label on every drawer was beautifully . hand calligraphed . because i had dropped out and didn't . have to take the normal classes . i decided to take a calligraphy class to . learn how to do this . i learned about serif and sans serif . typefaces about varying the amount of . space between different letter . combinations about what makes great . typography great . it was beautiful historical artistically . subtle in a way that science can't . capture . and i found it fascinating . none of this had even a hope of any . practical application in my life . but 10 years later when we were . designing the first macintosh computer . it all came back to me . and we designed it all into the mac it . was the first computer with beautiful . typography . if i had never dropped in on that single . course in college the mac would have . never had multiple typefaces or . proportionally spaced fonts . and since windows just copied the mac . it's likely that no personal computer . would have them . if i had never dropped out i would have . never dropped in on that calligraphy . class and personal computers might not . have the wonderful typography that they . do . of course it was impossible to connect . the dots looking forward when i was in . college but it was very very clear . looking backwards 10 years later . again you can't connect the dots looking . forward you can only connect them . looking backwards . so you have to trust that the dots will . somehow connect in your future you have . to trust in something your gut destiny . life karma whatever . because believing that the dots will . connect down the road . will give you the confidence to follow . your heart even when it leads you off . the well-worn path and that will make . all the difference . my second story . is about love and loss . i was lucky i found what i loved to do . early in life . woz and i started apple in my parents . garage when i was 20. . we worked hard and in 10 years apple had . grown from just the two of us in a . garage into a two billion dollar company . with over four thousand employees . we just released our finest creation the . macintosh a year earlier and i just . turned 30 . and then i got fired . how can you get fired from a company you . started . well . as apple grew we hired someone who i . thought was very talented to run the . company with me and for the first year . or so things went well but then our . visions of the future began to diverge . and eventually we had a falling out . when we did our board of directors sided . with him . and so at 30 i was out . and very publicly out what had been the . focus of my entire adult life was gone . and it was devastating . i really didn't know what to do for a . few months . i felt that i'd let the previous . generation of entrepreneurs down that i . had dropped the baton as it was being . passed to me . i met with david packard and bob noyce . and tried to apologize for screwing up . so badly . i was a very public failure and i even . thought about running away from the . valley . but something slowly began to dawn on me . i still loved what i did . the turn of events at apple had not . changed that one bit . i'd been rejected but i was still in . love . and so i decided to start . over i didn't see it then . but it turned out that getting fired . from apple was the best thing that could . have ever happened to me . the heaviness of being successful was . replaced by the likeness of being a . beginner again less sure about . everything . it freed me to enter one of the most . creative periods of my life . during the next five years i started a . company named next another company named . pixar and fell in love with an amazing . woman who would become my wife . pixar went on to create the world's . first computer animated feature film toy . story and is now the most successful . animation studio in the world . in a remarkable turn of events . apple bought next and i returned to . apple and the technology we developed it . next is at the heart of apple's current . renaissance . and laureen and i have a wonderful . family together . i'm pretty sure none of this would have . happened if i hadn't been fired from . apple . it was awful tasting medicine but i . guess the patient needed it . sometime life sometimes life's gonna hit . you in the head with a brick . don't lose faith . i'm convinced that the only thing that . kept me going was that i loved what i . did . you've got to find what you love and . that is as true for work as it is for . your lovers . your work is going to fill a large part . of your life and the only way to be . truly satisfied is to do what you . believe is great work and the only way . to do great work is to love what you do . if you haven't found it yet keep looking . and don't settle . as with all matters of the heart you'll . know when you find it and like any great . relationship it just gets better and . better as the years roll on so keep . looking . don't settle . my third story . is about death . when i was 17 i read a quote that went . something like . if you live each day as if it was your . last someday you'll most certainly be . right . it made an impression on me and since . then for the past 33 years i've looked . in the mirror every morning and asked . myself if today were the last day of my . life would i want to do what i am about . to do today . and whenever the answer has been no for . too many days in a row . i know i need to change something . remembering that i'll be dead soon is . the most important tool i've ever . encountered to help me make the big . choices in life . because almost everything . all external expectations all pride all . fear of embarrassment or failure these . things just fall away in the face of . death . leaving only what is truly important . remembering that you are going to die is . the best way i know to avoid the trap of . thinking you have something to lose . you are already naked . there is no reason not to follow your . heart . no one wants to die . even people who want to go to heaven . don't want to die to get there . and yet . death is the destination we all share . no one has ever escaped it . and that is as it should be because . death is very likely the single best . invention of life . it's life's change agent it clears out . the old to make way for the new . right now the new is you . but someday not too long from now you . will gradually become the old and be . cleared away . sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite . true . your time is limited so don't waste it . living someone else's life . don't be trapped by dogma which is . living with the results of other . people's thinking . don't let the noise of others opinions . drown out your own inner voice . and most important have the courage to . follow your heart and intuition they . somehow already know what you truly want . to become . everything else is secondary . stay hungry . stay foolish\n",

Google that man you're alone you're . alone you may have a shrink you're going . to you may have a best friend you going . to but there's 24 hours in the day where . you're alone in this brain and your . brain is talking to you in all kind of . ways and it wants to control you and . pull you in these different pockets if . you can't control your own brain and . your brain controls you you're you got . to tell your brain where you want to go . and how you want to go and how you want . to get there you got to control it if . not it's over . but existed for me was okay man how am I . gonna make this work and all I knew back . then was hard work the only way anything . gets accomplished that's all I heard . back in those days you got to work hard . you got to work hard I'm not getting how . did I can't get this paragraph I can't . remember what this paragraph to pass . this test to get the military breathe . again . I'm still not getting it read again but . it's not getting it write it out and now . I started learning okay well I can't I . gotta write out everything I do and then . write it out again and write it out . again and guess what happened I got it I . got it . I can't swim I'm negative buoyant go . back again I can't swim go back again go . back again go back again I got it I . realize if I keep going back and going . back and going back until this just . becomes your mind was safe okay we're . gonna figure it out because he is not . going to stop it's like I'm gonna try . one more time no I'm gonna it's just . like long clock goes off Boop we're . going back I can't read right we're . going back . I gave myself no way out and my mind . realized that they said okay we're gonna . adapt and overcome now like a lot of . people say trying hard they your mind . knows man it knows this guy's bull guys . lying there's no truth behind it when I . was a Navy SEAL training people oh how . are you there for 18 months the program . is always six months long you were in . three hell weeks in one year no one's . ever done that how did you do that I . talked about the new norm when I lived . in the $7 a month place and I was . growing up for a short period of time I . loved it I don't know you know any . different that was my norm once we move . down that place we moved to $236 month . place I was like I never want to go back . to that little pieces but if you go back . to that seven dollar month place and you . realize this is where I live . that's all I got your mind says Roger . that this is home so when I was going to . Navy SEAL training for 18 months and . going back through all the hard part's . over and over again I told myself after . the first time I knew this could be a . long journey there my body was breaking . down it was it was just how it was going . on I see know what this is my new normal . so my mind said is that going to work . like you go to work you put your suit I . on I'm going to suffering every day . every day suffering being broken duct . taping my feet up stress fracture shin . splints being broken this is my new norm . and your mind says if we're not broken . just say normal we got to be broken so . then your mind starts to get tougher and . tougher and more cast people huh how did . you run on broken feet broken broken . shins my mind knew this is how we . operate we're a Navy SEAL training this . is what we are I health and that became . my new norm I gave myself no way out . there was nothing outside these walls of . hell nothing I became I love God but for . a short period of time I became the . devil because that was hell . I became I became the boss the owner the . CEO of Navy SEAL training that was my . mindset and that's how you get through . things you put yourself you immerse . yourself wherever it is you become that . you become that and give yourself . nowhere yeah when I was tours in 97 . pounds and I was fat as hell trying to . be a Navy SEAL the scariest thing in the . world to me even to this day was that . that could have been the rest of my life . I thought then I was trying hard that's . the scariest thing in the world I . thought then two or 97-pound working for . Ecolab's spraying for cockroaches making . $1,000 a month I thought that was me at . my 100% potential come to find out a few . years later I wasn't even near that 106 . pounds less graduating Navy SEAL . training we don't do all these other . things looking back on that that was me . trying hard that's why people got . understand what is in us we have no idea . until we start trying hard and I mean . really trying hard where you're obsessed . with hey this is my new norm my new norm . is that wow this isn't always fun it's . not always meant to be fun and that's . when you know you're trying hard . people hear my story and think this . guy's sadistic I realize how the how the . brain works I figured out how the brain . works I'm a scared kid and that's what . gives me so much power . I had no foundation and I built this off . of just researching the mind the feeling . you get is basically invincibility you . realize that you can't do it all the . time when you need to do it I know I can . go to a place that I can live in and . when you know that you can run on broken . legs and you can do certain things that . a lot of people can do but they're not . willing to do this power this . sympathetic nervous system of fight or . flight and you're fighting it gives you . this charge of energy over when you're . sitting there at 3:30 4:00 o'clock in . the morning and you're duct taping your . feet up because they're broken and . you're doing it by yourself and you're . going to do arguably one of the hardest . training in the world and these guys . most of them are healthy and you're . going through it broken and you already . at a disadvantage but you're still there . you can feed into that and tap into that . for a lot of power but if you look at it . while I'm broken man like I'm not gonna . make it if you look at it as man I'm . broken and I'm still here and I'm . fighting and I'm gonna find a way to get . through this because I have no other . place to go it gives you a lot of power . when things start to suck really really . bad my brain and a lot of people's brain . DUP they don't go to your dad beating . you up your brain says win it right here . this is miserable so anger goes away a . lot of times when you're suffering . because your brain that says we got a . run we got to go so that anger is not . popping up saying oh I'm gonna . show them I want to show those people no . there has to be a much deeper if I say . deeper it has to be down to mineral . mineral soil it has to be down to that . nice mineral soil where nothing can burn . you can't burn dirt so it has to be down . that low that literally is submenu . that's at the core your soul . and but you but you don't find it unless . you spend a lot of time with what you . want to be in life you I can't give that . to you right you can't give it to . somebody when when you find your true . passion in life and my passion for me . when like I want to be now given my Navy .

There will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged,  . to lose your passion  . and think that it's not meant to be. . But if you're going to reach your destiny,  . you have to have a made-up mind. . If you give up after the first time  . or the fifth time or the 30th time,  . what that really means is you didn't want it bad enough. . There should be something you're believing for . that you are relentless. . You are not moved by how impossible it looks,  . you're not discouraged by how long it's taking,  . you don't give up because people told you no, . you're attitude is,  . \"If I have to believe my whole life,  . I am not going to stop believing,  . I am not going to take no for an answer,  . I'm not going to settle for mediocrity,  . I'm going to keep pursuing   . what put in my heart.\" . and ask ourself, \"What do I really want?\" . What do I really want? . And write it down. .

That's changed the world. . Think of that. . But what keeps that competitive edge . What keeps you on top is the ability to think  . and prepare mentally over and over and over again. . The body has limitations. . The mind does not. . We focus so much  . on what goes on the neck down . that we forget it all starts from here. . Everything starts from there . If you're not mentally ready,  . you're never really physically prepared. . And that's where the preparation starts. . What would your life be like?  . As you look toward the future, if you decided . I'm not going to allow my fears to stop me. . And I'm saying to you, whatever you gotta do, . Do it. Because if your don't . life is gonna whoop you until you surrender. . So when you're young and you make mistakes, . don't let 'em eat you up, . 'cause everybody that done made it done made 'em. . You got to fail in order to win. . Hey, look, man. . To understand how to hit the game when it's shot, . you got to miss the game when it's shot. . You know, you got to be tough because  . the road to success is always under construction. . It's never a clear path to success. . The people who become successful are the people who have . a relentless attitude. . And you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks, . 'cause the bad breaks is comin', . but they usually come right before the big break . is about to happen. . You get a series of bad breaks . and it stumbles up a lot of people. . My life and my success is to say to anyone, . \"You can stumble, you can fall, . you can get back up again.\"\n",

musical . perfect role for me i thought . except for the fact that i can't sing . i didn't get the job . but here's the thing . i didn't quit . i didn't fall back . i walked out of there to prepare for the . next audition and the next audition and . the next audition . i prayed . i prayed . and i prayed . but i continued to fail . and fail . and fail but it didn't matter because . you know what . there's an old saying you hang around . the barber shop long enough sooner or . later you're gonna get a haircut . so you will catch a break and i did . catch a break . last year . i did a play called fences on broadway . but here's the kicker . it was at the court theater . it was at the same theater . that i failed that first audition . 30 years prior . the point is every graduate here today . has the training and the talent to . succeed . but do you have the guts . to fail . if you don't fail . you're not even trying . i'll say it again if you don't fail . you're not even trying . to get something you never had you have . to do something you never did . imagine you're on your deathbed . and standing around your deathbed . are the ghosts representing your . unfulfilled potential . the ghost of the ideas you never acted . on . the ghost of the talents you didn't use . and they're standing around your bed . angry . disappointed . and upset . they say we we came to you because

really do we need it from you young . people i mean i'm not speaking for the . rest of us up here but i know i'm . getting a little grayer . we need it from you the young people . because remember this . you got to get out there . you got to give it everything you got . whether it's your time . your your your talent . your prayers . or your treasures . what are you going to do with what you .

kindness some . of you have loved some of you have the . gift of long-suffering whatever it is . whatever your gift is . what are you going to do . with what you have . all right now here's my last point about . failure . sometimes . it's the best way . to figure out where you're going . your life will never be a straight path . i began at fordham university as a . pre-med student . i took a course called the . cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it . i couldn't say it i surely couldn't pass . it . so then i decided to go into pre-law . then journalism and with no academic . focus my grades took off in their own . direction . i was a 1.8 gpa . and the university very politely . suggested that it might be better to . take some time off . i was 20 years old i was at my lowest . point . and then one day and i remember the . exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my . mother in her beauty shop my mother . owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon . and there's there was this older woman . who was considered one of the elders in . the town and i didn't know her . personally but i was looking in the . mirror and every time i looked in the . mirror i could see her behind me and she . was staring at me . she just kept looking at me every time i . looked at her she kept giving me these . strange looks . so she finally took the dryer off her . head and said . she said something i'll never forget . she said young boy . i have a prophecy a spiritual prophecy . she said you are going to travel the . world . and speak to millions of people . and in the years that follow just as . that woman prophesies i have traveled . the world and i have spoken to millions . of people through my movies . millions who up until this day . couldn't see me . who up till this day i couldn't see . while i was talking to them and they . couldn't see me they could only see the . movie . they couldn't see the real me . but i see youth today . and i'm encouraged by what i see . i'm strengthened . by what i see . because taking risk is not just about . going for a job . it's also about knowing what you know . and what you don't know . it's about being open to people . and to ideas . the chances you take . the people you meet . the people you love . the faith that you have . that's what's going to define you . never be discouraged . never hold back . give everything you got . and when you fall throughout life . remember this . fall forward . you\n",

            " . empowerment is authority . it is a sign permission slip to actually . seize the day . it's the process of getting stronger and . more confident and more engaged and to . be empowered is to move through the . world without any kind of fear or any . kind of apology . and with these gifts comes an even . deeper privilege i believe and that is . the ability to take charge of your own . life to own yourself and claim your . rights and here's what i know for sure . that to whom much is given much is . expected and i have been given so much . i've earned it . i've been blessed with it . but i've been given a lot . and that's why i've chosen to use my . life to lift other people up . nobody's journey is seamless or smooth . we all stumble we all have setbacks if . things go wrong you hit a dead end as . you will . it's just life's way of saying . time to change course . so ask every failure this is what i do . every failure every crisis every . difficult time i say what is this here . to teach me . and as soon as you get the lesson you . get to move on if you really get the . lesson you pass and you don't have to . repeat the class if you don't get the . lesson it shows up wearing another pair . of pants . to give you some remedial work . and what i found is that difficulties . come when you don't pay attention to . life's whisper . because life always whispers to you . first first and if you ignore the . whisper sooner or later you'll get a . scream . whatever you resist persists but if you . ask the right question not why is this . happening but what is this here to teach . me what is this here to teach me it puts . you in the place and space to get the . lesson you need my friend ed cartole . uh who's written this wonderful book . uh called a new earth . that's all about letting the awareness . of who you are stimulate everything that . you do he puts it like this he says . don't react against a bad situation . merge with that situation instead and . the solution will arise from the . challenge . because surrendering yourself doesn't . mean giving up it means acting with . responsibility . i have a very big light . and so people with big lives can do big . things and so i started to think about . what was the best christmas i ever had . in my life i grew up poor . on welfare with my mother for part of my . life . and i remember the best christmas of my . life was when i was 12 years old and . my mother had said we're not going to . have christmas . because we can't afford it . i remember feeling like . it's going to be really hard . on christmas morning to go outside . what am i going to do when everybody . else is outside . that's what i thought what am i going to . do when everybody else is outside and . what am i going to do when i have to go . back to class and say i got nothing so . that's what i was mostly worried about . and then some nuns showed up . some three nuns came to our house and . they gave me a doll and they bought us . food and we had our christmas that was . the best christmas of my life because . somebody remembered and i wasn't going . to have to be . the kid that said i got nothing so i . wanted to be able to create that same . feeling for . children who had nothing . so i decided to go to south africa . originally i wanted to do a million kids . and then just realized with i only had . four weeks vacation so in four weeks i . could not reach a million kids because i . didn't want to just write a check . send a donation i wanted to be able to . look in each kid's face and say to that . child somebody remembered you and so . that's what i did with my life this . christmas i took 41 people from here . hired another 50 people over there and . we were traveling caravan from one . village to the next we did 2 000 kids a . day . we had parties for children who were . orphans . and it was singularly i will tell you i . could weep thinking about it the . singularly the best experience of my . life . the singularly best experience of my . life the first day in africa where we . had 280 kids in a room and every single . one of those kids had lost a parent . every single one of those children they . were aged three . to 17 in that room and my team that . you're talking about i have the greatest . team in the world my team in the here in . the united states had been in contact . with the orphanages so that by the time . we got there . we had a present with every child's name . on it . this summer every black doll . manufacturer in the country had sent me . dolls because i these girls had never . seen black dolls and so it was my . mission to do for them what the nuns had . done for me was to let the african girls . see a black doll so i wanted every girl . to have a black doll i wanted every boy . to have soccer balls we bought radios we . bought clothes and the most important . thing is we had their names on every box . for every child . and i called up the children one by one . and when those children you know . received their gifts and then waited for . the next child to receive their gifts . and said i said nobody can open their . presents until everybody can open their . presents and on the count of three when . i counted the three and those children . open their presents was the single . greatest moment of my life . i have a big life so i can take 50 000 . presents and do that over and over and . over again to orphanage effort orphanage . but what i felt in that room for those . from those kids . is a lot of what you're talking about . and what you're talking about and what . you see in the faces of those women when . you look into the eyes of someone . and you give them a gift whether that be . a physical gift or it be a gift from . your spiritual self from your presence . from the essence of you and you see the . light you see the joy what i felt in . that room was not just that i was . remembered that the child felt that i . was remembered but you felt a sense of . hope a sense of validation a sense of . validation that somebody cared about me . and i will tell you that of all the . years and shows that i have done . and every theme for every show that i've . done . the single common dynamic denominator . that i've found that every human being . is looking for is validation . every single person needs to know . wants to feel that they matter . that they matter and what happened in . that room that was the greatest day of . my life . i knew that those children knew in that . moment that they mattered that they . mattered and so i encourage you it's . exciting to be able to write a check . it's even more exciting to be able to . touch one life . to be able to do that for one person . it's like cynthia was saying when you . can do that for one person when you can . do that you will know that your life has . meaning and i will tell you when i left . that place my friend gail and i were . there and we're all boohoo and we're . like boom with the children oh my gosh . and gail was saying what is it what is . it we're so full as gail said to me she . said you know as big as your show is as . big as your show is what happened in . that room seemed bigger . what happened in that room sing bigger . and that is true that is true for me who . has this big life in a television show . and i'm telling you for everybody here . extending yourself beyond your world . your kids your family your stuff and . reaching out to somebody who is not like . you somebody who is like you who is . indeed if you are feeling depressed or . you are feeling down or you're feeling . like things aren't going the way you . want them to go in your life the way you . turn that around is to reach outside of . yourself to somebody else reach outside . of yourself to somebody else it will . change you . it will change you . so it is my intention . my intention . to fulfill the dream of the creator . it is my intention . to live to the highest calling and be . pressed to the mark of the highest . calling that i have come to do . and when you can ask the creator . ask that which made you you . what is your dream for me . i guarantee you instead of you trying to . define the dream what is your dream for . me . if you're able to lean . into the dream . that the universe and all the forces of . of of of light and love and power and . grace by all the names that we call god . has for you . nobody can touch you . nobody can touch you . so . you\n"

            " . wow . the attention of the qriketing world . returns once again to the capital city . of sri lanka colombo and to their . biggest cricket stadium as we pick up . the t20 series . the first of three news from the middle . sri lanka have won the toss they can . have a ball first . the two teams lots of changes a few . new faces in both teams sri lanka . handing out two debuts . one to charitas and charming . the other india handing out two caps as . well to crippy shaw . and baron . beautifully bowled beautifully bald they . struck early . they have first ball pretty sure goes . what a lovely delivery that was . it swings late and the line was such . that pritisho had to play at it . jamiro strikes . pretty sure without scoring not for one . india . boundary a boundary to end the second . 12 for one . shot great shot wonderful from sanji . sampson . that's four more four more . is it carried has it carried he loves . the catch . they're gonna have a little look . upstairs they're gonna have a little . look upstairs . let's have a look for the soft signal . which the umpires reckon is a no . let's have a listen . oh what do you make of that what do you . make of that the soft signal is no . i'm gonna go with knot out i think that . bounces just before his fingers . but he saved his team four that was . racing away i think the right decision . right now the skipper in the company of . sanjay samson . going along well that's the first big . hit and that's massive . straight behind the baller and well . beyond the side screen as well . picking it early not an easy bowler to . come down to akilah the ninja . delivery well done indeed . sanju samson dead as a duck . strikes of the very first delivery he . bowls . india 51 for two sanju samson goes for . 27. . ripped away in the gap and that's four . short and that had to be put away in the . gap . and sodium . but dealt with . very clever . indeed . got it has he got it you bet he has . all the way what a shot against the spin . this time captain shaker darwin chancing . his arms . there you go knocked each other but . still went through it . first six in three innings . the mystery spinner aquila is coming . under pressure it's gone for 35 and he . hasn't completed three . and that should be four as well that's . beautifully struck . too much flight for the said batsman . swept away he's found the gap he's found . the gap and he's hit it well enough . that's not a good sight let's hope it's . a passing shower . chance in the deep chance in the deep . oh nearly misjudged it as well . has he got enough he doesn't he doesn't . he doesn't have enough he's gone . another soldier by champ this time . sheikha down . finds that lone fielder at deep . squaligashin bandara . it's a good running catch the most . important wicket . for the sri lankan the two better . stealing batsman going there . a wicket on debut flicked away there's a . man in the deep . he has to make up a little bit to his . right . that holds on to it and yes you should . celebrate the first of many maybe . for karuna ratner the captain played . well shika darwin . he played well but in the end he goes . for 46 indian r1 . 13 for three . got it he's got this one yes yes . that's a biggie . he's looked to go this side of the . ground . fairly often it's the shorter side again . slower ball this time he's picked it . and he knows there's plenty of space . square of the wicket . crucial over hasaranga . starts off well surya kumar yadav . that's this half century 33 balls . he's a special player just look at that . able to hit it on the up hit it straight . hit it clean . should be taken will be taken he has the . last laugh . plays with a lot of heart that's exactly . what he is telling everyone . this clever bowling deceives a man on . fire . sure mariada cannot believe what he's . just done . will that go for four that's speeding . away yes it does . so ishan kishan into the act . oh that's one heart should go all the . way . six runs to ishan kishan . kishan is deep inside the crease though . slightly . but what works in his favor is the extra . pace that . offered him on that occasion . that's been swung away is that sweet . or dropped . didn't hang on . it's a long boundary there very long . boundary . one big one for chamira he's been very . very good . 10 off 12 india 153 for five . that's been swung away but not powerful . enough . for it to find the boundary so just one . of the last ball of the 20th over . just nine of that over so this has been . good finishing . from sri lanka as india get to 164. . they're the first t20 international here . at the r premadasa and that's what sri . lanka need . 165 of their allotted 20 overs . to take this first t20 international . vervenet sure kumar has a slip for . abhishek . shaw woman on the other side of the . circle two inside the circle on the leg . oh as soon as he shows not tall enough . to grab that . four of the very first delivery but it . could have been a wicket . oh very well played got well inside the . line got plenty of bat on it . first ball four for me now showing his . level of confidence . up and oh burst through the hands . i think that's hardly fun there there . he catches that every single day of the . week . except today . is that edged yes given by . the empire but he'll go upstairs now . i do think that's 50 50 could have . struck perhaps uh . the thai guardian . roll forward roll forward . flat line flat line when the ball passed . the bet . very happy to overturn his decision that . was off the pipeline . up in the air again this time taken come . on . not very smartly done by me note lucky . to get away earlier . this one straight to surya yadav . no protection on the offside no one on . the boundary so . minnows looking to clear that area . minot goes for 10. sri lanka 23 for one . cut oh and again i think uh surya yadav . got . his fingertips to that and it was struck . so . hard . straight behind the bowler very full . easy pickings . avishka's in good form another boundary . over mid-on easy calculated . and a boundary . cleaned him up what a delivery he got a . wicket of the first delivery in the . first odi . second delivery the ninja silva's inning . comes to a close . what a wonderful experience delivery . yeah absolute braille trimmer . goes for nine sri lanka 48 for two . swung away and it's gone straight into . the hands . of prithvi a shot . sanju samson not what sri lanka wanted . the said batsman . taking the lone field that deep squalic . sanju samson didn't have to meet an inch . that sounded good and that's gone the . distance . welcome to the crease panda what a shot . by charity . look at that what a great shot young man . down leg unfortunately doesn't get a . boundary for that . has he done enough now let me show a . little late with that dive oh that . struck very well now with that go all . the way . and just over the boundary line about a . yard or so . now if you're needing to take a chance . it's got to be from here charitasalanka . targeting . the lakeside . up in the air nobody there clever shot . a couple bounces for a boundary oh . got him while he . have a slightly slower delivery it's . been hard work for pandara . in the middle it's not often that . you'd say but sometimes you feel . a wicked could

            " . starting these matches nowadays and that . process must be adhered to here we go . underway and through could be underway . with a boundary it will just run away . from you down there . at these short straight boundaries . overworked . that'll do nicely thank you very much . it's a good first over for new zealand . 12 coming from it . is like all young fast bowlers . oh that's what he does that's what gupta . will do to that ball that's . just short of the length . circle and then a very backward point as . well . they're unlikely to have a man station . there . 25 without loss . i'm going to come out swinging . oh so close and this should go for four . as well . so luck is favoring the brave right now . behind square maybe gonna bowl a bit . shorter . no he's gonna toss it up and he's gonna . get . smashed over his head for six and a big . one at that . oh chipped it chipped it . just went for four we hardly hit it . now that is control that comes out the . fingers differently . it just took three it just took a few . locks . before gupta decided to climb into it . and therefore the short ball doesn't . work either . oh he went up he went full again and he . paid the price the line was different . but it's just as good a result for gupta . real dynamo lives and maher in the world . knows that . stoinis crunch . one bounce for nearly six . this is a start and a half beautiful . oh they'll run away as well what new . zealand have done tonight . tarpon striker well as they've hit gats . they've timed it beautifully . paula monroe is looking over wide . midwicket here . about there and it's found it quite . nicely . looking and delivered that length . doesn't work so well . see that happening all the time . oh that's lucky could run away good . chase . but chrislyn bails out he's had some . injury problems that might have been a . good . goes the timing there very very good . 20 rows back half a chance there you . missed it . 107 . oh that's massive a huge strike up into . the deep midwicket region and . capital has 50. . now monroe gets it too and monroe has . 50. . unbelievably good this from new . zealand's point of view . that could have been brilliant . get your hands around that can't . just carries on richardson down on the . boundary wasn't that far from him . early on but you get that i have . capitalized . oh here's another fireworks are going . over the screen into the crowd . a . just standing it's air time not down yet . world angel tithing . i don't believe it surely not surely . this didn't go all the way . what did it got them there in the first . place . it's a length ball she's going to be . plenty more all the way . eleven always wanted this fantastic . crowd tonight just a tickle it gets to . the boundary in a flash . well this is how simon dole and the . bulldog said that new zealanders would . straight to the field of deep square . makes no mistake . this is where you've got to get players . trying to hit it to the longest . boundaries . the length . there's nobody there only the camera . crew . 14 i don't think enough bowlers go to . the yorker . soon enough . well that's just got an extraordinary . shot it's gone up in the air i thought . this will be four more perfectly placed . he is on fire tonight . down the ground again mid on comes in . he's already said he's six more . yeah this is what drives stay 88 . from 47. that is massive that is just . so high goodness me . it certainly went higher than it went . longer it's still over six . trademark from gotzel not looking once . he's hit it keeps the head down . so far up in the air glenn maxwell even . though it only went about five or six . meters . 94 . has his second t200 . on his backyard outstanding knock . martin gupta dangerous player . clean hitting of the qriket ball to all . parts of the ground . just checking that last one but was . signaled by the field in the deep but . hit the . boundary on the full which is six . confirmed there and hit firmly . oh very clever very nifty the confidence . of youth . good stuff 206 for two 16 gone . 44 runs conceded in two and a half overs . now then this could be out should be out . there's out . this time maxwell gets it right and . guptor's magnificent knock here at eden . park . comes to an end . they are on their feet and so they . should be . good response from the crowd even the . australians are getting in . congratulating what was a magnificent . performance from martin guptill . the low full toss was the delivery that . brought him undone pretty close to that . waist high as well . maxwell in the deep very . safe hands and the end of a great knock . yeah an economy rate wise ashton agar . has been the best of the australian . bowlers . wow that's out that's gone skiing . in the most unfortunate way mark chapman . has to leave the ground he's had his . helmet knocked off his head back onto . the stumps . so billy stanley does have a save . this is a dismissal you don't see very . often . quite a nasty one it would have been a . nasty blow to the head without the . helmet . but uh how often do you see that . and that decided to give it a go out . of the old days oh that's dragged on as . well beautifully bold took all the pace . out of it . and a few hiccups coming at the end . yes inside edge . this could be out as well yeah . comfortably taken ty in the date again . and pace is pulled back and again . williamson can't find the timing . yeah you're right one eighteen white . smithy again . is it over the top it is yes that is the . late momentum . and that is 50k is it i think it is got . to get it in the zone tyre you've got to . get it in the zone . it's there taylor gets it and gets it . for six to finish . how appropriate is that some vic hitting . from . shall we say the senior man and new . zealand are going to finish tonight . at 243 for six and to be fair . this crowd of 30 000 plus have hardly . sat down . through the whole 20 overs simply . amazing stuff . as well . over the top yes it is chipped but timed . from david warner 11 without loss after . one . two with 50 grand . cats on edge go all the way as well . deep over that's ridiculous . it's a thick outside . inside edge more luck everyone's a . winner . hot chocolate . cricket it's earned his way into this . australian side . this time oh my goodness me oh you feel . you feel for the bowlers surely . but he's a cracking butt this is a new . one thick inside edge stick outside . four . i was just looking to see it both of . those boundary fielders . out on the left . down diving away tim seifert pick up . four . always a chance is this it's in the air . a long time . gets that one gets it behind square . picks up four and more . 16 from that over australia off to a . flyer 43 without loss . oh another one another inside edge might . not pick up four this time . so so he stopped but no he can't just . kept running away from him . we were just saying darcy shaw . swung away will it go all the way yes it . will yes . it will you betcha . where's mitchell is he out there . high in the air and long way over long . on as well . another six for david warnup great . striking . too short too short four more adam to . the extras bumble . gotta get together new zealand getting . away australia . well he's going to have to do something . because this is just becoming . a riot here . five men inside the circle on the off . side . saudi gets hit straight for six . just a chip just the chip . that's extraordinary let that guy's fuse . now then that is massive again huge . top deck west stand no doubt there . six anywhere 91. . that has hit so hard so hard . tour delivery and australia have a . hundred already . david warner has 50 off just 20 balls . and he isn't finished yet . through the middle has been new . zealand's weapon . that's a bad delivery and it costs it . again . just being pressured into bowling . mistakes . that's the wicked new zealand needed . and it was the google david warner going . on the back foot to try and hit it away . to the onside . and misses it completely maybe just a . lack of pace off the . surface and straight through the end of . a fine innings from the skipper . 24 for one . now that's is up and over and it didn't . look to be that well timed . solely down the ground this will test it . on and off and they get nowhere near it . went like a tracer bullet i know you . used to be crowds but what do you think . of the atmosphere here . oh look it's absolutely amazing you know . you talk to a few of the rugby union . boys that play here all the time . there's a look at that dave . unfortunately what we'll do is we'll . head upstairs but we'll see all the very . best thanks man . that takes it as martin gupta yeah look . he blows the raspberry out there . almost death like in the approach there . this time he goes land and he gets . smashed for the onside . oh it's as easy and as simple as you . like . look out in hospitality it's coming your . way . i just hardly missed the blockhole but . that's all it takes today . another one high into the stance . see he's trying to vote full and . straight or full but he's missing goes . short again that's risky really risky . yeah . and it's four more 162 for two . string of wickets when no one could find . the middle of the fence his wheeler . and there goes wheeler it's not . wheeler's night . i was just going to say ben wheeler . coming back for his third over . having another guy . and again over the offside this is in . the gap too does it go all the way . not quite he's come back he's pulled two . balls here wheel . to play the little little scoop shot . now he goes short the slower ball and . that is some brilliant batting that is . some . outstanding play . well just clear thought but the task at . hand that they should be . tremendously confident . and that helps that was just a long hot . though . and he just picked the spot and smashed . it . punched down the ground dead straight . yes another boundary they are making a . mockery of this . quill . they got him maybe a bit of bottom edge . involved . max was furious with himself it was on . for him to close the deal as he did the . other night not tonight though . oh that's too high i think yeah it's . been called no ball . so there's going to be a free hit that . is the worst possible result from new . zealand's point of view . oh this got away as well . the bowlers get the yips uh . yeah we do we do hurricanes apologize to . all hurricanes fans . straight up tim seifert be the man . you are so using bolt has worked . is there a late charge coming . that is huge for new zealand . bolt's the man . beautiful shot wouldn't that be a ball . but the way he worked it down the fine . leg . was superb so that's a huge australia . not possible . not now maybe one of the most eventful . overs you'll ever see has finally come . to an end . 25 for one it produced absolutely . chocolate sedan park . sunday night . beautifully done against the angle . coming into him . that is superb and very clever . goodness me how big is that . and that is that as they say . that is that the catch that means . absolutely nothing to that bloke except . he should hold on to the ball and put in . his pocket . but the fact of the matter is this that . massive hit from aaron finch has put a . full stop . on a world record run chase by australia . and can you believe it they have seven . balls to spare seven balls to spare . that's extraordinary\n",

Knights are having a horror sure here . I just knew what he had to offer both on . and off the field as a good how hard is . it to Don things around for it for your . team you know when their first game yeah . look we lost horribly but the end of the . day it's just one game in the tournament . and it's important that we still remain . positive and with clear minds they don't . need a coach jumping down the 27 for the . loss of six that's a high full toss . close to a hundred I can't with that put . an air hostess on it it's over the roof . he's a strong striker airborne add some . serious air miles on it yeah he loved it . as well just a shimmy and off . do 130 I was talking about it was who . runs away outside edge and I won't chase . it down there's some good fortune that's . the 50-50 for six you know they have got . the old rounders in you you always want . to have your one of your regular batsmen . out there throughout the 10 overs if you . want to really sleep oh yeah that's a . good strike please got all of that he's . got the big blind and a big hit you for . a six every time you bought that Blin . this was a quicker delivery easy for him . to just get under it . and swing that back bliss always going . another one that's gone for six . back-to-back six . just gonna have a look and see if it . goes it sit on the floor does it seeks . it's two in a row . this isn't it away Oh is he going out of . it I think he has just it's a big iover . 23 from it so it's exactly what they . need a trio bits remaining then out 69 . 4-6 the Pepsi catch an eight-course . Saturday you'll see a lot of people . coming especially in the evening when . the lights are on mixed up cutting out . of the keeper and another week it'll . fall and that was headless ran and the . non-striker did not want to go wonder . whether he was ball watching yeah I . think he was just looking at the ball . and looking at if the field is gonna . miss it or not and did not hear the fall . from the striker the news easy runs a . big opportunity to finish it off and . needle a lot of these players playing . this format nicely played good deft . touch flick all the way . then we gotta catch the one that's going . into the crowd and she kept so it looks . like they're gonna surpass that it'll . look like it for a while don't handle . Parnell it's a little flick using the . pace beautifully and it went a long way . oh yeah well that's smart that's what . you're talking about that's the slow . ball again and moved on its way and . danced away because it deserves a good . dancing . yeah very even final ball that's a good . shot that is a really good shot . that's like Shahzad yesterday . and now they're 92 for seven moaning . there it goes that'll be a boundary 98 . they're close to a hundred what a . recovery this has been by the Knights . has changed and they've changed it with . their lower order to bear delivery from . Cuddy yeah he's looking for that your . coat but yeah what a wonderful look come . back you know thanks too piggish score . having been five to twelve well yes well . played and what a finish . the Knights have recovered 103 for seven . yeah that was 59 for one being in the . mine the sevens we could fill 70 100 3 4 . 7 and look 23 from 14 and the . partnerships down the bottom got them . there then we're in Parnell first and . bowling was superb . there's a matter hog-eye me get yourself . in the game in the field first ball . you've got a tight . Cyndi's versus Kerala nights live from . Sharjah cricket stadium bill hanging in . there and then Wayne Parnell with a . brilliant in instance . lutely is it like him I I think he's an . unusual style play hits in areas that . are not common and therefore he's . finding gaps often as the wicked till we . could just leaked four runs right who . have we got Tom Curran coming on to ball . yeah and he was expensive yesterday so . he's got to try and find the ocean it's . a smash and six be easily done by depth . which he was quite expensive in . particular one of his overs yesterday . because of the lengthy bowls and if . you've got the leverage and that ability . that Dipsy chairs as most of these . batsmen do it's just a natural strike . it's another head down the ground couple . of bounces and into the fence we talked . for fours and sixes well the reason I . say I think they play Tambe smartly is I . think because he's such a wise . campaigner and he can't get him away too . often he's almost the guy were you . trying not overs and then you start to . look at the damage at the other guys . Karen went for the thirty from his two . overs yesterday and the first one went . for twenty-one and straightaway . look at this Rama's picked up by . deficits he made it look so easy . I Randy yeah just stayed where he was . and use the pace and ball boy they're . taking a very good catch . yeah there's acreage of open area that . you just think of last night after the . game . Karen would have been thinking right . what did I do wrong that over that went . for 2009 play the shots or such a . glorious straight drive from Shane . Watson 25 from the over it's a massive . overhaul the Cyndi's 29 without a wicked . tea without a wicked in 2.2 well that's . how you play a t10 you've got to go for . it and you take a band or any which way . through the legs French cat as they say . in fact behind that back leg dip . stitches on strike glares the front leg . and hits it sweetly into the gap what a . good shot down at a time with even . though it's Cpl and he's a lovely chap . as well talks it simply talks himself . down he said I've just to slaughter I . just get out there I just don't swing . the bat that's gone that's lap four six . pick the wrong on and hit it across the . line against us bend dips it . there's magnificent tonight . and how much uh can you be thinking . about the wrong end of the left hand . like he got the stumping yesterday that . it was the length covers the thumbs and . well Paul are there is so good with . these caches the one hand me over steps . and then the free hit . it's smash for six surge ask it's over . the rope but all the same it is cost . plenty cost plenty now they moved to . fifty seven hits it hard why not shot . that is he's brilliant he's brilliant . and he has to be an opener they got it . wrong in the West Indies he has to bat . at the top . you think if it's t20 he's got six overs . a pair play where it blow there he goes . slicing it past the feeling for for . Shane Watson because it turned out to be . a no ball it's been downhill ever since . that moment for North a free hit went . for six deficits then took a liking and . hit him hard four fours and then no i oh . that's a half it that do very nicely for . Shane Watson it's a big six . absolutely brilliant with that straight . shot well that's what I love about him . he keeps it simple that's wise so . consistent because it goes down the . ground oh that's a big one that's done . the distance and how almost hits the . roof he I he loved it as well made a . great sound . if it got from here on in the air . someone's gonna catch that it's . comfortable it's did such that has to go . cheeky little googly from lemak Charney . yeah wanted to go big didn't get all of . it that's gonna stone with useful . numbers mind if it was down the line . that's down the line that's over the . line over the line . Watson's not gonna miss our this swell . set now is playing really well that's . his third six off the inning is he gone . with the ah that's even better it's a . little flick such control here from . Watson well fancy catch a crook . very similar action replay stroke this . one he timed it even better those in the . crowd nobody giving it giving it a try . to catch that maybe it did got a hand . now let's just go on the other side now . sees Shane Watson been through the . onside time to go through they're loving . it . well that's a convincing win then good . thing B is on he battered well in the . last game the pause level very . comfortable victory in the end and . rightly so to the cinders and the Camden . sees it all the way through with a half . century little reading care we go over . these red outfits Shane Watson marvelous . performance after that deficits played . extremely well and the captain himself . the skipper Shane Watson got this is . this date belongs to the bowlers we have . seen a couple of head tricks and end . table ever Tommy was outstanding picking . up but not only five acres but major . Ricketts the the veteran leg spinner . absolutely tremendous and pan out and . the partnership of 103 5 for 15 with 10 . dots that has just obscene and T 10 . units horrible start they got and in the . endeavor said she just missed out on an . opening stand of a she was the only . wicked for her young son deep picking up . his wicked for 14 and it was pretty easy . for the Cindy's to get that turtle . Honduran Pope one of mana the match to . Praveen tombe for his five wickets . including a Hetrick for maximum sixes . and it's shared man white . Wayne Parnell and Anton DIF such and . Shane Watson to be let's not fight over . this boys and it's for stylish player . goes to entrant deficit . 49 of 20 balls wonderful hitting from . the left-hander H of the match and it . goes to David Malan for taking that . wonderful cash to dismiss Paul sterling . you\n",

            " . we are at the green park here in Kanpur . we've been here many times as players . before but today it feels a little . special because this is now the venue . for the 500 Test match for Indian . cricket which is quite an achievement . Ravi Shastri is here with me just four . nations have managed to play 500 Test . matches that's a large number and Indian . cricket should be really proud of this . fact absolutely because it's a long . journey started in 1932 so you know you . know they played all these years they've . sustained the interest of the people you . know Test matches were hard to come by . you know in the early years but you know . what's what we are seeing today is . fabulous you know and we are at a . heritage ground this is one of the . oldest grounds in Indian cricket when . India had its first original when you . scan pool was one of them yes so you . know it's it's amazing how history just . writes his own script India played its . first Test match in 1932 the hundredth . Test match Mansur Ali Khan patottie was . the captain happened in 1967 35 long . years to play their first hundred Test . matches and and again tribute there you . know to the Board of Control for Cricket . in India to sustain the interest you . know to invite teams from overseas . invite the right teams you know it would . cost money you know they would want . retainers they would want bank . guarantees in advance but by calling . those teams like the West Indies the . Australians you know when New Zealand . when they were strong you sustained the . interest of the public you know and what . you did was ensured that the Indian team . got good competition and became stronger . decade by decade we are talking Test . match forget but you a part of that 1983 . World Cup winning squad the response the . reaction there was a lot of adulation . fanfare but not too many financial . rewards I mean that is a big change when . India wins now there's also financial . rewards with it no but that was the one . single moment you know that redefine the . way people looked at cricket in this . country as a sport you know parents . wanted young kids to play the game your . corporate houses came behind backing the . sport like never before . you know the sudden interest or the . just the way the cricketer was looked at . by the armed junta by the the corporate . crowd you know by the blue collar was . totally different and India started . playing well you know they they enjoyed . that attention they got you know they . the performance is short you won the . World Championship after that you know . you again staged the World Cup in India . where we lost in the semi-finals but you . had a sequence of good performances you . know which when television came into . India exploded and that's why today like . I said to you earlier it's a small scale . industry you mentioned it's a billion . dollars porneia yeah it's a fact it's a . billion dollar small scale industry is . settled it yeah so much has change over . the years you were being part of this . whole chain this long journey as a . player as a broadcaster you've also had . held responsible positions within the . cricket team as well if you look at . Indian cricket say maybe in the 70s 80s . and now 2016 what is the big change you . see with the brand of cricket that India . is played . I think fabulous it's like I say they're . the back Piper's of world cricket . wherever they go you get huge audiences . and obviously that has to reflect on . some of the great players who played in . that time you know the fact that they've . handed on the baton to a good young . generation who play attractive cricket . and let's not forget you know it's . evolved the game has evolved perfectly . from India's point of view you know you . have Test cricket then you have 50 over . cricket and then you have twenty20 . instant cricket you know which I think . the game needs all three formats . you know Test cricket will benefit . because if the money that's made out of . 50 over cricket and 2000 cricket is . channeled back into the system at . grassroot level you keep having a strong . test team for your stew I'm glad you . brought that topic on because this is . not just about raving about Indian . cricket this is also a time when you of . course there's a cause for celebration . 500 test magic this match is a big deal . so you celebrate that landmark but . there's also a matter of concern with . regards to Test match cricket some . efforts are being made to make . Test cricket viable bringing the . audience's people at home as well you . know the that number can go bigger how . do you think that that can happen and is . it possible at all with the changing . tastes of the modern audience it is . possible if there is good competition . you know if there's good competition it . is very possible also I think you don't . need to tweak it because luckily cricket . has three formats you know you have . games like football baseball they . haven't changed . barring one or two rules nothing has . changed in over 100 years . so you don't want to tweak it too much . to confuse the common man you have three . formats so leave Test cricket as it is . for God's sake leave the ball the same . red color only reason why that is being . attempted Ravi's to ensure that you play . at a time when people are not working . yeah because when they are at work it's . not possible even if they like Test . match cricket to watch it and I think . that is the reason why they are doing it . Tampa by all means but you know I would . rather have a session under that's the . point you made earlier a session under . light maybe three hours under lights . which means you start not little late it . start at 1:00 o'clock or 12:30 make sure . the game gets over by 8:00 8:30 so . people can go back home but the . different thing you give them you don't . have to change anything too much you . know both sides know they will have to . back one session with a red ball and the . lights wickets might fall runs might be . scored anything can happen but the rules . stay for both sides it's how you adjust . adjust ended up as long as it's not . dangerous I don't think it's dangerous . with lights here today and that could . suddenly start getting in more people . you know attractor you know make it more . attractive for the television audience . so as well you know these are the things . you want to try and think but without . trying to tweak it too much now these . obviously are long-term challenges that . I'm sure the world cricket is aware of . it they look at this as one of the goals . to achieve the challenge for . Indian cricket and the BCCI is what's . happening in the courts the court orders . the low-doc Commission their . recommendations so it's a it's a huge . deal . Indian cricketer . you know have to tackle a lot of these . recommendations which they find are . unfair and might stifle the growth of . Indian cricket some feel that Indian . cricket will not be able to stand on its . feet if all these recommendations were . put into place what are your views on . that see I didn't get a chance to speak . to the loader committee right but they . are X Supreme Court judges and they have . got experience you know so obviously . they've gone through a lot of stuff . they've spoken to a lot of people and . come up with a lot of recommendations . now when it comes to governance when it . comes to administration you know where . if they felt that things weren't going . well they've got every right to mention . what can be done the same with . governance another brief that they had . been given was to sort out the fixing . problem you know how do you sort it you . know there has to be it cannot be a bill . has to be passed it you know you should . know what has to be done where a guy is . punished in such a fashion that it . deters other players from doing it it . which means a recommendation to . Parliament to pass a bill you know which . can put a guy in the clink so that no . one else will want to do it again fine . but there are certain areas we know . where I thought that you can still have . a dialogue with the loader committee . because those are things if applied it . could take the game back it will be tend . to become like for example the . cooling-off period yeah okay why would I . want to join the bc's here why would any . player want to join the BCC if I have an . idea that is something constructive that . I can do contribute in three years . you're telling me to go but what can . anyone achieve in three years he gets to . come back but the cooling cooling off . although I know the guy and after me is . competent enough if I have done a . competent job I should be respected for . my competency and where I think six . years is no harm after that if you have . to sit out for three years come back for . another six fair enough but six years is . enough time even the presidential . candidate of the country it's a . five-year term hmm you know unless . something happens and there's an . election in between he stays for five . years . you know and that's anywhere in the . world yeah any other recommendation that . you're eating I thought the selectors . that you know three when I played the . game I thought three selectors was . enough but today the way the game has . evolved with the three formats of the . game the interest that exists in the . country the combined number of people . that play the game in India is more than . the population of all the countries that . play cricket together . so if Australia has three selector . that's fine it's 20 million people 17 . million people here you have 1.2 billion . I mean you're asking that poor guy too . much you know he'll get serious travel . miles yeah you know if he is one of the . three will go from one end to the other . of the country and still not be able to . do a job I think five is still in order . and another thing you know I've always . believed there's no substitute for . experience hmm you know we say that in . cricket . this is something I've learned from the . sport it's something I've learned when . I've interacted with people from . different you know different fields in . life whether its corporate whether it's . sport whether its administration you . name it and I certainly believe in what . I am saying there's no substitute for . experience and we've got a couple of . guys in the board you know they're 70 . plus but they'll forget a youngster . they'll give anyone from any field a run . for their money you know I'm not . targeting anyone or anything because . I've I've seen them work yep . I've seen them as administrations I . don't to single out or take names I've . seen them working people know who I'm . talking about . because I don't mince words in any way . but they are outstanding so you know and . these things if you try and push it . immediately it might just be detrimental . at this moment of time so if you have to . make a final sort of assessment and . roundup of the load ah recommend your . dialogue but still continue you know for . all of you think it's a bit under it . shouldn't be like a boxing bout I think . there has to be some you know where . genuine effort should be made you know . ideally from both parties to have a . dialogue on certain things which you . know can work most of the . recommendations are anywhere accepted . and the board is trying to do something . but you know this . this tree cooling period is harsh and . also if you want cricketers to come into . the system spell out this is a . professional job look wicked I will want . to do a non read job yeah it's a . professional job you know you you played . cricket for six hours in your time you . know at times when you see what people . get today you got peanuts you know but . then if you pay peanuts you get monkeys . so get get professional professional . will write the right number on the money . what should be given for this job that . job whatever comes their way make it . professional you see a lot of cricketers . coming into the system well thank you so . much Rabia for talking really . passionately about this it's a very . sensitive topic but I've been very . amazing I'm passionate Sanjay is because . it's a great cricket playing country it . is and if things were that bad you won't . have achieved what you have achieved . we're celebrating five hundred Test . match you won two World Cups you're . number one team in the world . so all cannot be wrong yes there might . have been areas which you know you . needed a whack on the backside to be . corrected you know but could that be the . reason why some feel it's a bit extreme . I won't say extreme dialogue I'm saying . dialogue you know a dialogue because . let's be practical if it can work or not . work you know because we want Indian . cricket to carry on we don't want it to . go back five years you don't want this . team to suffer five years you'll have . they'll be total chaos . other teams get the upper hand and then . again you have to try and climb up the . ladder dividing to be fair let's say . let's get back to what is really . important which is you know cricket on . the field and as I said 500 tests might . on this venue it said okay we've all . been tests we get fans it's the ultimate . test for a cricketer 500 Test match we . are celebrating that today thousand Test . match for India possible or you'll test . cricket my struggle to read the or it . can happen as easily as the last sort of . 300 matches have happened see I'll tell . you you know it's again personalities I . believe who make the sport we had one . gentleman yesterday who played 40 . percent yeah okay . inspire generation after generation when . he played the game and there were . another little fellow before him . exactly and before that the spinner see . every era has superstars but when you . have someone like a Tendulkar who played . across two and a half generations and . where everyone in this team literally . worships you know suddenly from this . team if you get an individual you know . barracks already outstanding you get two . three more individuals who carry on that . the good job that was done by the . players earlier exactly what Kapil Dev . said the other day and he's a legend the . law is to take a number of people caps . you know really write inspired so that . will make people ten years down the line . twenty years down the line wanting to . play Test match cricket and twenty years . down the line no be whole you might be . 1,000 and 1,200 you're talking about . peanuts you pay peanuts you get monkeys . maybe Test match cricket remuneration . also could get a limit I am as high as . the highest between I so plus or maybe . t20 cricket fifty where I put into Test . cricket finance and said Robert thank . you so much stuff there's always fresh . rock and it was a sensitive topic that . came in between but I'm - nice of you to . address I didn't get a chance to speak . to the panel but since you asked me the . question I told ya you were directing . the team now say your back man I didn't . have that I meant yeah and the open . conflict of interest don't do anything . then thank you very much thanks for the . stretcher well that's it from us\n",

India Pakistan matches neighbor over 160 . did you think you've done well to . restrict India well of course they have . a strong batting lineup and restrict . them in 157 and that that were our plan . to we have to stick with 160 and we done . it but unfortunately our betting line of . doesn't go through so that's why we lost . the game but they're the way they're . bowling the bowling superb what went . wrong was it poor short selection or . tension pressure that one I don't think . so that was one pressure but we had a . few bad shots . that's why we'll lose that game you've . enjoyed this twenty20 tournament you . should feel proud because Pakistan . played could forget to reach the final . of course the way they're playing our . guys it's so probably and inshallah . we're gonna off straight after that we . have series against South Africa and we . looking forward to it and inshallah we . working hard again . tough luck sure but better luck next . time thank you sure Malik the captain of . the Pakistan team well now the man of . the match award for an outstanding . bowling performance today in the middle . of the innings and to take three . important middle wickets for Pakistan . for India alpha and Pathan for a spell . of three for 16 . they found will collect the man of the . match award excellent figures . well it found outstanding performance . you'll be delighted because when you . came in to ball you were under a bit of . pressure now martial arts it's a great . feeling . we come back from my side and obviously . being the world cup it's amazing and . obviously when I came I was a bit of I . was in under a bit of pressure but bowl . full my nerves and boolean ideas we saw . you mixing your pace a lot a lot of . slower deliveries what was a pitch light . was a ball coming on to the bat or was . it a little slower than the normal . Johannesburg pitch which was a bit on . the slow side I was holding a bet when I . will expect the split-finger slow ones . but so that's why I had to active go a . little slower because obviously back . when we're going after the gulen yeah . now they needed more than a transfer . over so this was trying to just make . some space in between just try to get . given a quick one as well okay and what . was going through the player's mind when . those final over started pressure . obviously was a it could have gone . anywhere like miss ball haka was playing . pretty well but I think joking the ball . really were are really well and picked . up all the ball is not only joking the . whole the bonus did really well tour . through other term and RP all the other . bonus as well sheesh on that they old . but he they all ball pretty well we . played as a team we feel that really . well we better really well and I think . this dessert especially what happened . after the World Cup . well done it fun go well thank you it . found put on man of the match in this . 2025 . the next the player of the tournament . the player who's been the most . consistent in the tournament and that . man is shahid afridi of pakistan runs . over the bat wickets with the ball child . if you can come up and collect the award . from a Sri Molly player of the . tournament . well shiet many congratulations you'll . be disappointed you couldn't pull it off . today first of all I want to thanks . mighty Allah winning illusion doesn't . matter but we guys played really good . cricket energy I want to give . congratulation to Indian captain and all . the Indian nations now tough situation . today when you came on to bat and you'll . be disappointed with the short who play . but that's a natural game isn't it I'm . already struggling with no betting I . really focused on my balling and . fiddling as well but yeah and I want to . mention one more thing because before . this I coming then this event friend of . mine said him so he said you will be the . man of the series so this is for him . thank you so much and how have you . enjoyed this twenty20 format the crowds . have been brilliant atmosphere fantastic . oh it's a great fun and we all enjoy it . is a good entertainment that I think ICC . need after every two years they go for a . World Cup better luck next time share . well the Indian team now will have to . come up and collect their medallions in . alphabetical order Ajith a Gurkha . Pierce Charla Gotham gamble Dinesh . Karthik - Putin Yusuf Patan the render . server . Joginder Sharma Rohit Sharma Harbhajan . Singh RP Singh Yuvraj Singh Swisher . and Robin Uthappa and of course the . captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni who will . just connect the Madeira name . furthermore . so the Indian players just collecting . their medallions enjoy if you can come . up please . many congratulations how does it feel . and I think it's one of the things that . I've achieved in the last three at one . of the things I treasure for the whole . life in the rest of my life and I think . it's really amazing I'm really excited . and I would like to congratulate the . boys over there and likely thanks them . for the effort and for the response that . they have given me I think it was really . amazing the young side event we came to . the tournament no one expected us to win . and the way we have won the final match . I think we deserve a big celebration . Pakistan did extremely well to restrict . you to 160 and they played good figure . as well I think the ball very well you . know it the wicket was not really doing . too much but I think from the 12th or . onwards the way good and Arafat Bowl I . think that was really really really . excellent but we knew one thing we . scored 150 or 160 still they have to . score it and we always know the run rate . it's always always over six so if you . get quick quick wickets and later on if . I can pressurize the bats when it gets . really hard now what was happening in . those final two overs there must have . been a lot of thoughts going through . your mind choking the sharma Harbhajan . Singh Joginder Sharma Harbhajan Singh . what made you give Joginder that last . over I think but he was 100 wasn't sure . and I was not getting the yorkers right . so I felt you know instead of giving up . bowler was not hundred percent sure I . should give a bowler who wants to do . well at that international never even if . I if we would have lost the match it . doesn't matter to me but I think the way . Jogi Bowl it was really good . now what does this be to you this you . know what would you think this would do . for Indian to do well one thing for sure . the 2020 version will catch up in India . the excitement and the type of game it . is I think it will be a big hit in India . apart from that I think now after we . lost after the way we departed from the . World Cup initially you know in 2007 I . think it will do it will do the repair . work for some time and we have to keep . keep doing it in Australian series . followed by Pakistan then we are off to . Australia so we have to do consistently . well now before you go here this out the . BCCI has announced an award of two . million dollars for the Indian team . and a core of repairs for your rats in . for hitting his six sixes in an oval na . manja you can go up and collect the big . one the world twenty20 Champions India . and when the same Tony gets the award . from mr. Ramani where the fireworks have . started here it's time for the Indian . team to look it's been an outstanding . performance and these are scenes have . been watched by millions around the . world there will be fireworks with India . for sure but at the end of it all it's . been a magnificent tournament . beautifully organized and like I . mentioned at the start a massive massive . success India the world TT champions . pictures that they would savor for a . very long time to come young man with . ambition in their heart and they arrived . there with no one expecting them to win . and they've gone on to win the first . edition of crickets youngest child . they'll pump their fists and they'll let . that dreams fly today it was an . absolutely fantastic moment two young . teams two unheralded teams have given . this ICC World twenty20 the best . advertisement it could have could have . ever got this was this was absolutely . fantastic - Nguni the young man will . embrace each other all night these are . moments you cherish if you're near a . sportsman you want to live trophies you . want the world to watch you wanna have . little memories that you're gonna keep . by with you and these are fantastic . memories books really gospel drum is . Raja know what it is to have lifted the . World Cup and I'm sure you know what . they're going through just now oh yes I . know I think it's just gonna be you know . for us for starters they'll just be . screaming they won't be saying anything . they'll just be saying here whatever it . is and that's it they will be doing . nothing else excepting screaming and by . the time they get back to the dressing . room they'll be exhausted by all the . screaming and then they'll start and . have a bit of champagne to to you know . to get rid of the past and dry throats . and then after the champagne is sunk in . after a couple of glasses of champagne . or something then they won't remember . what they do they go I think they'll . start screaming again clouds have been . fantastic as well it's been a very . well-supported tournament this the ICC . World twenty20 as Robbie said in the . presentation very well-organized . tournament all of us who enjoyed being . here and at last we got a final to . remember when you've been through so . many finals that have turned out to be . anticlimax isn't your class got a final . backrooms the tournament deserve oh . absolutely I think coming so close by . for that football for the finals was . just the right kind of finals that you . would want because really it was it was . a very very close again that's the kind . of game that you want to wonder what I . think this victory certainly will help . mind us in Dhoni to become a better . leader because he's been fantastic . Travis t20 competition but I think it'll . lift him as a leader because he did have . the stars with him we had a young team . and to win a world away but just been . fantastic . yes they'll be enjoying that as well . he's built with this chapter India . anthem is virtually being an ambassador . so that's the way it's looking at the . moment India that crowd winners of the . first ICC was 2020 and as the . celebrations continue we'll take a . little break back in just a normal . enjoyed yourself to\n",

Vietnam veterans would show up in my . barracks room and the first thing they . do is inspect my bed if you did it right . the corners would be square the covers . would be pulled tight the pillows . centered just under the headboard and . the extra blanket folded neatly at the . foot of the rack it was a simple task . mundane at best but every morning we . were required to make our bed to . perfection it seemed a little ridiculous . at the time particularly in light of the . fact that we were aspiring to be real . warriors tough battle-hardened seals . but the wisdom of this simple act has . been proven to me many times over . it matters not whether you ever serve . the day in uniform it matters not your . gender your ethnic or religious . background your orientation or your . social status our struggles in this . world are similar and the lessons to . overcome those struggles and to move . forward changing ourselves and changing . the world around us will apply equally . to all if you think it's hard to change . the lives of ten people change their . lives forever you're wrong . I saw it happen every day in Iraq and . Afghanistan but changing the world can . happen anywhere and anyone can do it so . what starts here can indeed change the . world and you will likely fail often it . will be painful it will be discouraging . at times it will test you to your very . core at that darkest moment of the . mission is a time when you need to be . calm when you must be calm when you must . be composed when all your tactical . skills your physical power and your . inner strength must be brought to bear . if you want to change the world you must . be your very best in the darkest moments . if I have learned anything in my time . traveling the world it is the power of . hope the power of one person the . Washington a Lincoln King Mandela and . even a young girl from Pakistan Malala . one person can change the world by . giving people hope . start each day with a task completed . find someone to help you through life . respect everyone know that life is not . fair that you will fail often but if you . take some risks step up on the times . you're the toughest face down the . bullies lift up the downtrodden and . never ever give up if you do these . things the next generation and the . generations that follow will live in a . world far better than the one we have . today and what started here will indeed . have changed the world for the better . finally a seal training there's a bell a . brass bell that hangs in the center of . the compound for all the students to see . all you have to do to quit is ring the . bell ring the bell and you no longer . have to wake up at 5 o'clock ring the . bell and you no longer have to be in the . freezing cold swims ring the bell and . you no longer have to do the runs the . obstacle course the PT and you no longer . have to endure the hardships of training . all you have to do is ring the bell to . get out . if you want to change the world don't . ever ever ring the bell\n",

            " . a wise person once told me . dreams don't work . unless you do . we're trying so hard . in our lives to fit in we try to fit . into certain groups certain threats . certain sororities you know among . certain friends . yet the people we idolize are most are . the ones that stand out but when you're . prepared . there is no fear there is no fear of . failure because even if you've walked . out of something and you feel like you . failed at it . your preparation is so strong . that you're gonna take that failure and . turn it into the outcome you desire . and most people stop at failure okay . we've all failed at things . i'm going to continue to fail at stuff . right . it's the most powerful tool you can use . but it all depends on how you use it . what would your future be like . if you decided to to want that which you . desire so strongly . that it prepares you past your fears . that you experience the fear as the one . book says feel the fear and do it anyway . life is 10 percent what happens to you . it's 90 what you do about it no matter . who you are no matter where you are in . life you can take the lid off of your . jaw and and if . if you're wondering if you still have . the lid on in your life here are some . clues that's going to let you know that . the lid is still on if you're not . excited about waking up in the morning . if you're sitting around bored out of . your mind . if you got time to do everything anybody . asks you to do . you probably got the lid on . if when you tell your dreams to all your . friends it makes sense to them . you got your lead on man your dreams . should be should not make sense to . everybody you got to say something to . make people go how you going to do that . that's when you got the lid off and if i . were you i'd do that i take the lid off . makes sense to me . they're always going to get ready to get . set to get going what we've got to do is . boom just like that move into action . every time you remember your dream . you're removing some dirt you're digging . it back out . the true mark of a champion is even . though some dirt gets thrown on your . dream instead of letting it get buried . you keep shaking it off you keep moving . forward you keep looking for a new . opportunity . you wouldn't be having that opposition . if you didn't have something great in . you . if your dream wasn't alive and on track . right on schedule to come to pass you . wouldn't have so many things coming . against you . that dream is still alive . you may have tried a year ago . five years ago or 40 years ago . didn't work out . nobody was there to help you . go back and try again . this is your time . this is your moment . your destiny is calling out to you can i . tell you . your dream is not dead . it's just not in season . your time is coming promotion is coming . good breaks are coming promises you've . been standing on . dreams you've been praying about . lack is not your destiny . constantly

break free from this depression this . is my year to meet the right people this . is my year to get healthy and whole this . is your year to see double this is your . year for vindication for restoration for . new beginnings now get your mind going . in the right direction . here's the secret . the people that do the most with their . lives the people that seem . the most self-assured the ones that seem . to embody confidence the ones that seem . to define . confidence . they're the ones that had to face down . the most fear they simply didn't linger . in it don't hate your competitors . respect your competitors . learn from him . i had a very important person my life . come to me and say who's your hero and i . said i don't know i gotta think about . that give me a couple of weeks . i said i thought about it you know who . it is i said it's me in 10 years . so i turned 25 10 years later that same . person comes being though so are you a . hero and i was like . not even close . she said why is it because my hero is me . at 35 so you see every day every week . every month and every year in my life my . hero's always 10 years away i'm never . going to be a hero i'm not going to . obtain that i know i'm not that's just . fine with me because that keeps me with . somebody to keep on chase . that's the thing success and failure are . generally . slow processes . either slowly building things up . or gradually . tearing them down . and . that's why i say you've got to pay . attention . you have to . watch you have to watch . every single second . choose love . and don't ever let fear turn you against . your playful heart i believe in . manifestation i believe in . putting a rocket of desire out into the . universe and . and you get it when you believe it you . get it when you believe you have it and . that's the key so we want to get really . sensitized acutely sensitized sensory . acuity to whether what we're doing is . working or not and by the way sensory . acuity is really the measure of a . person's intelligence . what i mean by that is how do we measure . intelligence . intelligence is a measure of the number . and quality of distinctions you have in . a given situation . you can handle this you just haven't . figured it out yet it's all right this . is your training period this is the . tuition you have to pay for what you . don't know . you can do this other people have done . it doesn't take an einstein . get you some people that can teach you . some stuff that you don't know get you . some people that have done it . successfully and learn from them take . some seminars workshops read some books . on how to manage a business . change the way you see yourself and . begin to tend to the personal details . understand that nobody's going to take . care of your business better than you . you will notice the most successful . people in any field they are usually the . ones who have failed more than anybody . else you see the difference between a . successful person and everyone else it's . not a lack of strength it's not a lack . of knowledge it's a lack of will . you must experience what this life is . totally isn't it . before you go . you must experience this if you do . experience that . then such questions will never arise in . your mind because . that's not the way existing things . it's up to you in a world where we're . taught to look outside for answers for a . job that will make us happy for money . that will make us happy that answer is . within we already have it . we already have the answer but will we . unleash it will we give it will we own . it will we truly reinvent ourselves to . become the people that were capable of . becoming . the bow too tightly strung as easily . broken says one of the problems . balance is a gorgeous thing . so . be monomaniacal in your execution around . your high value targets your hvts . your mission plan . but also build in some rewards and . that's going to send a gorgeous message . to your conscious and your subconscious . mind that hey this daily practice of . execution around my deliverables is a . beautiful thing and you create this . thing called momentum and the monk who . sold his ferrari i went back and i saw . this recently i think there's a whole . chapter on momentum and you become like . this i love skiing you start off small . but as you go down the slope you pick up . momentum a lot of people say robin where . do i start i want to start a new . business i want to become a better . artist i want to find the love of my . life i want to be a world-class creative . i want to . multiply my financial life where do i . start you just start . you just start there's great power in . the start . and when you start . life starts supporting . well god wants us all to be courageous . because he knows we'll face times in . life and situations and circumstances . that it takes more than just the desire . takes courage . many people operate on the basis of fear . on the basis of what other people think . we as believers should operate on the . basis of courage courage to say no and . we ought to say no courage to say yes . when we should say yes . so what kind of courage do you have is . your sort of floating between depending . on the situation . or do you know the difference between . right and wrong for your life . and you've made up your mind . you\n",

            " . today i want to tell you three stories . from my life . that's it no big deal . just three stories . the first story . is about connecting the dots . i dropped out of reed college after the . first six months but then stayed around . as a drop in for another 18 months or so . before i really quit . so why'd i drop out . it started before i was born . biological mother was a young unwed . graduate student and she decided to put . me up for adoption . she felt very strongly that i should be . adopted by college graduates so . everything was all set for me to be . adopted at birth by a lawyer and his . wife . except that when i popped out they . decided at the last minute that they . really wanted a girl . so my parents who were on a waiting list . got a call in the middle of the night . asking . we've got an unexpected baby boy do you . want him . they said of course . my biological mother found out later . that my mother had never graduated from . college and that my father had never . graduated from high school . she refused to sign the final adoption . papers . she only relented a few months later . when my parents promised that i would go . to college . this was the start . in my life . and seventeen years later i did go to . college . but i naively chose a college that was . almost as expensive as stanford . and all of my working class parents . savings were being spent on my college . tuition . after six months i couldn't see the . value in it . i had no idea what i wanted to do with . my life . and no idea how college was going to . help me figure it out . and here i was spending all the money my . parents had saved their entire life . so i decided to drop out and trust that . it would all work out okay . it was pretty scary at the time but . looking back it was one of the best . decisions i ever made . the minute i dropped out . i could stop taking the required classes . that didn't interest me . and begin dropping in on the ones that . looked far more interesting . it wasn't all romantic . i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on . the floor in friends rooms . i returned coke bottles for the five . cent deposits to buy food with . and i would walk the seven miles across . town every sunday night . to get one good meal a week at the hari . krishna temple i loved it . and much of what i stumbled into by . following my curiosity and intuition . turned out to be priceless later on . let me give you one example . reed college at that time offered . perhaps the best calligraphy instruction . in the country . throughout the campus every poster every . label on every drawer was beautifully . hand calligraphed . because i had dropped out and didn't . have to take the normal classes . i decided to take a calligraphy class to . learn how to do this . i learned about serif and sans serif . typefaces about varying the amount of . space between different letter . combinations about what makes great . typography great . it was beautiful historical artistically . subtle in a way that science can't . capture . and i found it fascinating . none of this had even a hope of any . practical application in my life . but 10 years later when we were . designing the first macintosh computer . it all came back to me . and we designed it all into the mac it . was the first computer with beautiful . typography . if i had never dropped in on that single . course in college the mac would have . never had multiple typefaces or . proportionally spaced fonts . and since windows just copied the mac . it's likely that no personal computer . would have them . if i had never dropped out i would have . never dropped in on that calligraphy . class and personal computers might not . have the wonderful typography that they . do . of course it was impossible to connect . the dots looking forward when i was in . college but it was very very clear . looking backwards 10 years later . again you can't connect the dots looking . forward you can only connect them . looking backwards . so you have to trust that the dots will . somehow connect in your future you have . to trust in something your gut destiny . life karma whatever . because believing that the dots will . connect down the road . will give you the confidence to follow . your heart even when it leads you off . the well-worn path and that will make . all the difference . my second story . is about love and loss . i was lucky i found what i loved to do . early in life . woz and i started apple in my parents . garage when i was 20. . we worked hard and in 10 years apple had . grown from just the two of us in a . garage into a two billion dollar company . with over four thousand employees . we just released our finest creation the . macintosh a year earlier and i just . turned 30 . and then i got fired . how can you get fired from a company you . started . well . as apple grew we hired someone who i . thought was very talented to run the . company with me and for the first year . or so things went well but then our . visions of the future began to diverge . and eventually we had a falling out . when we did our board of directors sided . with him . and so at 30 i was out . and very publicly out what had been the . focus of my entire adult life was gone . and it was devastating . i really didn't know what to do for a . few months . i felt that i'd let the previous . generation of entrepreneurs down that i . had dropped the baton as it was being . passed to me . i met with david packard and bob noyce . and tried to apologize for screwing up . so badly . i was a very public failure and i even . thought about running away from the . valley . but something slowly began to dawn on me . i still loved what i did . the turn of events at apple had not . changed that one bit . i'd been rejected but i was still in . love . and so i decided to start . over i didn't see it then . but it turned out that getting fired . from apple was the best thing that could . have ever happened to me . the heaviness of being successful was . replaced by the likeness of being a . beginner again less sure about . everything . it freed me to enter one of the most . creative periods of my life . during the next five years i started a . company named next another company named . pixar and fell in love with an amazing . woman who would become my wife . pixar went on to create the world's . first computer animated feature film toy . story and is now the most successful . animation studio in the world . in a remarkable turn of events . apple bought next and i returned to . apple and the technology we developed it . next is at the heart of apple's current . renaissance . and laureen and i have a wonderful . family together . i'm pretty sure none of this would have . happened if i hadn't been fired from . apple . it was awful tasting medicine but i . guess the patient needed it . sometime life sometimes life's gonna hit . you in the head with a brick . don't lose faith . i'm convinced that the only thing that . kept me going was that i loved what i . did . you've got to find what you love and . that is as true for work as it is for . your lovers . your work is going to fill a large part . of your life and the only way to be . truly satisfied is to do what you . believe is great work and the only way . to do great work is to love what you do . if you haven't found it yet keep looking . and don't settle . as with all matters of the heart you'll . know when you find it and like any great . relationship it just gets better and . better as the years roll on so keep . looking . don't settle . my third story . is about death . when i was 17 i read a quote that went . something like . if you live each day as if it was your . last someday you'll most certainly be . right . it made an impression on me and since . then for the past 33 years i've looked . in the mirror every morning and asked . myself if today were the last day of my . life would i want to do what i am about . to do today . and whenever the answer has been no for . too many days in a row . i know i need to change something . remembering that i'll be dead soon is . the most important tool i've ever . encountered to help me make the big . choices in life . because almost everything . all external expectations all pride all . fear of embarrassment or failure these . things just fall away in the face of . death . leaving only what is truly important . remembering that you are going to die is . the best way i know to avoid the trap of . thinking you have something to lose . you are already naked . there is no reason not to follow your . heart . no one wants to die . even people who want to go to heaven . don't want to die to get there . and yet . death is the destination we all share . no one has ever escaped it . and that is as it should be because . death is very likely the single best . invention of life . it's life's change agent it clears out . the old to make way for the new . right now the new is you . but someday not too long from now you . will gradually become the old and be . cleared away . sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite . true . your time is limited so don't waste it . living someone else's life . don't be trapped by dogma which is . living with the results of other . people's thinking . don't let the noise of others opinions . drown out your own inner voice . and most important have the courage to . follow your heart and intuition they . somehow already know what you truly want . to become . everything else is secondary . stay hungry . stay foolish\n",

I gave myself no way out and my mind . realized that they said okay we're gonna . adapt and overcome now like a lot of . people say trying hard they your mind . knows man it knows this guy's bull guys . lying there's no truth behind it when I . was a Navy SEAL training people oh how . are you there for 18 months the program . is always six months long you were in . three hell weeks in one year no one's . ever done that how did you do that I . talked about the new norm when I lived . in the $7 a month place and I was . growing up for a short period of time I . loved it I don't know you know any . different that was my norm once we move . down that place we moved to $236 month . place I was like I never want to go back . to that little pieces but if you go back . to that seven dollar month place and you . realize this is where I live . that's all I got your mind says Roger . that this is home so when I was going to . Navy SEAL training for 18 months and . going back through all the hard part's . over and over again I told myself after . the first time I knew this could be a . long journey there my body was breaking . down it was it was just how it was going . on I see know what this is my new normal . so my mind said is that going to work . like you go to work you put your suit I . on I'm going to suffering every day . every day suffering being broken duct . taping my feet up stress fracture shin . splints being broken this is my new norm . and your mind says if we're not broken . just say normal we got to be broken so . then your mind starts to get tougher and . tougher and more cast people huh how did . you run on broken feet broken broken . shins my mind knew this is how we . operate we're a Navy SEAL training this . is what we are I health and that became . my new norm I gave myself no way out . there was nothing outside these walls of . hell nothing I became I love God but for . a short period of time I became the . devil because that was hell . I became I became the boss the owner the . CEO of Navy SEAL training that was my . mindset and that's how you get through . things you put yourself you immerse . yourself wherever it is you become that . you become that and give yourself . nowhere yeah when I was tours in 97 . pounds and I was fat as hell trying to . be a Navy SEAL the scariest thing in the . world to me even to this day was that . that could have been the rest of my life . I thought then I was trying hard that's . the scariest thing in the world I . thought then two or 97-pound working for . Ecolab's spraying for cockroaches making . $1,000 a month I thought that was me at . my 100% potential come to find out a few . years later I wasn't even near that 106 . pounds less graduating Navy SEAL . training we don't do all these other . things looking back on that that was me . trying hard that's why people got . understand what is in us we have no idea . until we start trying hard and I mean . really trying hard where you're obsessed . with hey this is my new norm my new norm . is that wow this isn't always fun it's . not always meant to be fun and that's . when you know you're trying hard . people hear my story and think this . guy's sadistic I realize how the how the . brain works I figured out how the brain . works I'm a scared kid and that's what . gives me so much power . I had no foundation and I built this off . of just researching the mind the feeling . you get is basically invincibility you . realize that you can't do it all the . time when you need to do it I know I can . go to a place that I can live in and . when you know that you can run on broken . legs and you can do certain things that . a lot of people can do but they're not . willing to do this power this . sympathetic nervous system of fight or . flight and you're fighting it gives you . this charge of energy over when you're . sitting there at 3:30 4:00 o'clock in . the morning and you're duct taping your . feet up because they're broken and . you're doing it by yourself and you're . going to do arguably one of the hardest . training in the world and these guys . most of them are healthy and you're . going through it broken and you already . at a disadvantage but you're still there . you can feed into that and tap into that . for a lot of power but if you look at it . while I'm broken man like I'm not gonna . make it if you look at it as man I'm . broken and I'm still here and I'm . fighting and I'm gonna find a way to get . through this because I have no other . place to go it gives you a lot of power . when things start to suck really really . bad my brain and a lot of people's brain . DUP they don't go to your dad beating . you up your brain says win it right here . this is miserable so anger goes away a . lot of times when you're suffering . because your brain that says we got a . run we got to go so that anger is not . popping up saying oh I'm gonna . show them I want to show those people no . there has to be a much deeper if I say . deeper it has to be down to mineral . mineral soil it has to be down to that . nice mineral soil where nothing can burn . you can't burn dirt so it has to be down . that low that literally is submenu . that's at the core your soul . and but you but you don't find it unless . you spend a lot of time with what you . want to be in life you I can't give that . to you right you can't give it to . somebody when when you find your true . passion in life and my passion for me . when like I want to be now given my Navy . SEALs I mean roundish I want to serve my . country I cared about I want to be . someone that I'm proud of I want to look . at myself in American I was so . disappointed . that accountability man I talked about I . was so disappointed in what I saw every . day . I want everybody to love David Goggins . and a lot of people did I didn't love . myself . but I knew a lot of us want to find . peace first so gonna say man you always . talk about this suffering and pain . --is-- I'm at peace right now because . I'm going to do that you don't find . peace first if you do Merry Christmas . more power to you more power to you . I found peace on the opposite end of . finding myself and no one really finds . himself without going through trials . tribulations suffering accountability . and accountability is suffering being . accountable every day for doing right . for yourself for the people next to you . it's miserable it's hard so you know . even the smallest details . you\n",

There will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged,  . to lose your passion  . and think that it's not meant to be. . But if you're going to reach your destiny,  . you have to have a made-up mind. . If you give up after the first time  . or the fifth time or the 30th time,  . what that really means is you didn't want it bad enough. . There should be something you're believing for . that you are relentless. . You are not moved by how impossible it looks,  . you're not discouraged by how long it's taking,  . you don't give up because people told you no, . you're attitude is,  . \"If I have to believe my whole life,  . I am not going to stop believing,  . I am not going to take no for an answer,  . I'm not going to settle for mediocrity,  . I'm going to keep pursuing   . what put in my heart.\" . and ask ourself, \"What do I really want?\" . What do I really want? . And write it down. . Writing causes thinking, . thinking creates an image and you get these images  . And you get this images growing,  . your building a vision in your mind. . It's the visionaries. . That's changed the world. . Think of that. . But what keeps that competitive edge . What keeps you on top is the ability to think  . and prepare mentally over and over and over again. . The body has limitations. . The mind does not. . We focus so much  . on what goes on the neck down . that we forget it all starts from here. . Everything starts from there . If you're not mentally ready,  . you're never really physically prepared. . And that's where the preparation starts. . What would your life be like?  . As you look toward the future, if you decided . I'm not going to allow my fears to stop me. . And I'm saying to you, whatever you gotta do, . Do it. Because if your don't . life is gonna whoop you until you surrender. . So when you're young and you make mistakes, . don't let 'em eat you up, . 'cause everybody that done made it done made 'em. . You got to fail in order to win. . Hey, look, man. . To understand how to hit the game when it's shot, . you got to miss the game when it's shot. . You know, you got to be tough because  . the road to success is always under construction. . It's never a clear path to success. . The people who become successful are the people who have . a relentless attitude. . And you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks, . 'cause the bad breaks is comin', . but they usually come right before the big break . is about to happen. . You get a series of bad breaks . and it stumbles up a lot of people. . My life and my success is to say to anyone, . \"You can stumble, you can fall, . you can get back up again.\"\n",

less . than the one you're capable of living . now i'm sure in your experiences in . school and applying to college and . picking your major and deciding what you . want to do with life i'm sure people . have told you to make sure you have . something to fall back on make sure you . got something to fall back on honey . but i never understood that concept . having something to fall back on . if i'm going to fall . i don't want to fall back on anything . i want to fall forward . i figure at least this way i'll see what . i'm going to hit . without consistency . you'll never finish . so do what you feel passionate about . passionate about . take chances . don't be afraid to fail there's an old . iq test was nine dots . and you had to draw five lines with a . pencil within these nine dots . without lifting the pencil . the only way to do it was to go outside . the box . don't be afraid to . think outside the box don't be afraid to . fail . big . to dream . big but remember . dreams . without goals . are just dreams . reggie jackson struck out 2600 times in . his career the most . in the history of baseball but you don't . hear about the strikeouts people . remember the

failed experiment is one step . closer to success . got to take risks and i'm sure you've . probably heard that before but i want to . talk to you about why that's so . important . you will fail at some point in your life . it you will lose . you will embarrass yourself . you will suck at something there's no . doubt about it . and i know that's probably not a . traditional message for a graduation . ceremony but hey . i'm telling you embrace it because it's . inevitable . in the acting business you fail all the . time early on in my career . i auditioned for a part in a broadway . musical . perfect role for me i thought . except for the fact that i can't sing . i didn't get the job . but here's the thing . i didn't quit . i didn't fall back . i walked out of there to prepare for the . next audition and the next audition and . the next audition . i prayed . i prayed . and i prayed . but i continued to fail . and fail . and fail but it didn't matter because . you know what . there's an old saying you hang around . the barber shop long enough sooner or . later you're gonna get a haircut . so you will catch a break and i did . catch a break . last year . i did a play called fences on broadway . but here's the kicker . it was at the court theater . it was at the same theater . that i failed that first audition . 30 years prior . the point is every graduate here today . has the training and the talent to . succeed . but do you have the guts . to fail . if you don't fail . you're not even trying . i'll say it again if you don't fail . you're not even trying . to get something you never had you have . to do something you never did . imagine you're on your deathbed . and standing around your deathbed . are the ghosts representing your . unfulfilled potential . the ghost of the ideas you never acted . on . the ghost of the talents you didn't use . and they're standing around your bed . angry . disappointed . and upset . they say we we came to you because you . could have brought us to life they say . and now we have to go to the grave . together . so i ask you today . how many ghosts are going to be around . your bed when your time comes . i just got back from south africa it's a . beautiful country . but there are places there with terrible . private poverty that need help . and africa is just the tip of the . iceberg the middle east needs your help . japan needs your help alabama needs your . help tennessee needs your help louisiana . needs your help philadelphia needs your . help . the world needs a lot and we need it . from you . we really do we need it from you young . people i mean i'm not speaking for the . rest of us up here but i know i'm . getting a little grayer . we need it from you the young people . because remember this . you got to get out there . you got to give it everything you got . whether it's your time . your your your talent . your prayers . or your treasures . what are you going to do with what you . have i'm not talking about how much you . have . some of you are business majors some of . you are theologians nurses sociologists . some of you have money some of you have . patience some of you have kindness some . of you have loved some of you have the . gift of long-suffering whatever it is . whatever your gift is . what are you going to do . with what you have . all right now here's my last point about . failure . sometimes . it's the best way . to figure out where you're going . your life will never be a straight path . i began at fordham university as a . pre-med student . i took a course called the . cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it . i couldn't say it i surely couldn't pass . it . so then i decided to go into pre-law . then journalism and with no academic . focus my grades took off in their own . direction . i was a 1.8 gpa . and the university very politely . suggested that it might be better to . take some time off . i was 20 years old i was at my lowest . point . and then one day and i remember the . exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my . mother in her beauty shop my mother . owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon . and there's there was this older woman . who was considered one of the elders in . the town and i didn't know her . personally but i was looking in the . mirror and every time i looked in the . mirror i could see her behind me and she . was staring at me . she just kept looking at me every time i . looked at her she kept giving me these . strange looks . so she finally took the dryer off her . head and said . she said something i'll never forget . she said young boy . i have a prophecy a spiritual prophecy . she said you are going to travel the . world . and speak to millions of people . and in the years that follow just as . that woman prophesies i have traveled . the world and i have spoken to millions . of people through my movies . millions who up until this day . couldn't see me . who up till this day i couldn't see . while i was talking to them and they . couldn't see me they could only see the . movie . they couldn't see the real me . but i see youth today . and i'm encouraged by what i see . i'm strengthened . by what i see . because taking risk is not just about . going for a job . it's also about knowing what you know . and what you don't know . it's about being open to people . and to ideas . the chances you take . the people you meet . the people you love . the faith that you have . that's what's going to define you . never be discouraged . never hold back . give everything you got . and when you fall throughout life . remember this . fall forward . you\n",

is to move through the . world without any kind of fear or any . kind of apology . and with these gifts comes an even . deeper privilege i believe and that is . the ability to take charge of your own . life to own yourself and claim your . rights and here's what i know for sure . that to whom much is given much is . expected and i have been given so much . i've earned it . i've been blessed with it . but i've been given a lot . and that's why i've chosen to use my . life to lift other people up . nobody's journey is seamless or smooth . we all stumble we all have setbacks if . things go wrong you hit a dead end as . you will . it's just life's way of saying . time to change course . so ask every failure this is what i do . every failure every crisis every . difficult time i say what is this here . to teach me . and as soon as you get the lesson you . get to move on if you really get the . lesson you pass and you don't have to . repeat the class if you don't get the . lesson it shows up wearing another pair . of pants . to give you some remedial work . and what i found is that difficulties . come when you don't pay attention to . life's whisper . because life always whispers to you . first first and if you ignore the . whisper sooner or later you'll get a . scream . whatever you resist persists but if you . ask the right question not why is this . happening but what is this here to teach . me what is this here to teach me it puts . you in the place and space to get the . lesson you need my friend ed cartole . uh who's written this wonderful book . uh called a new earth . that's all about letting the awareness . of who you are stimulate everything that . you do he puts it like this he says . don't react against a bad situation . merge with that situation instead and . the solution will arise from the . challenge . because surrendering yourself doesn't . mean giving up it means acting with . responsibility . i have a very big light . and so people with big lives can do big . things and so i started to think about . what was the best christmas i ever had . in my life i grew up poor . on welfare with my mother for part of my . life . and i remember the best christmas of my . life was when i was 12 years old and . my mother had said we're not going to . have christmas . because we can't afford it . i remember feeling like . it's going to be really hard . on christmas morning to go outside . what am i going to do when everybody . else is outside . that's what i thought what am i going to . do when everybody else is outside and . what am i going to do when i have to go . back to class and say i got nothing so . that's what i was mostly worried about . and then some nuns showed up . some three nuns came to our house and . they gave me a doll and they bought us . food and we had our christmas that was . the best christmas of my life because . somebody remembered and i wasn't going . to have to be . the kid that said i got nothing so i . wanted to be able to create that same . feeling for . children who had nothing . so i decided to go to south africa . originally i wanted to do a million kids . and then just realized with i only had . four weeks vacation so in four weeks i . could not reach a million kids because i . didn't want to just write a check . send a donation i wanted to be able to . look in each kid's face and say to that . child somebody remembered you and so . that's what i did with my life this . christmas i took 41 people from here . hired another 50 people over there and . we were traveling caravan from one . village to the next we did 2 000 kids a . day . we had parties for children who were . orphans . and it was singularly i will tell you i . could weep thinking about it the . singularly the best experience of my . life . the singularly best experience of my . life the first day in africa where we . had 280 kids in a room and every single . one of those kids had lost a parent . every single one of those children they . were aged three . to 17 in that room and my team that . you're talking about i have the greatest . team in the world my team in the here in . the united states had been in contact . with the orphanages so that by the time . we got there . we had a present with every child's name . on it . this summer every black doll . manufacturer in the country had sent me . dolls because i these girls had never . seen black dolls and so it was my . mission to do for them what the nuns had . done for me was to let the african girls . see a black doll so i wanted every girl . to have a black doll i wanted every boy . to have soccer balls we bought radios we . bought clothes and the most important . thing is we had their names on every box . for every child . and i called up the children one by one . and when those children you know . received their gifts and then waited for . the next child to receive their gifts . and said i said nobody can open their . presents until everybody can open their . presents and on the count of three when . i counted the three and those children . open their presents was the single . greatest moment of my life . i have a big life so i can take 50 000 . presents and do that over and over and . over again to orphanage effort orphanage . but what i felt in that room for those . from those kids . is a lot of what you're talking about . and what you're talking about and what . you see in the faces of those women when . you look into the eyes of someone . and you give them a gift whether that be . a physical gift or it be a gift from . your spiritual self from your presence . from the essence of you and you see the . light you see the joy what i felt in . that room was not just that i was . remembered that the child felt that i . was remembered but you felt a sense of . hope a sense of validation a sense of . validation that somebody cared about me . and i will tell you that of all the . years and shows that i have done . and every theme for every show that i've . done . the single common dynamic denominator . that i've found that every human being . is looking for is validation . every single person needs to know . wants to feel that they matter . that they matter and what happened in . that room that was the greatest day of . my life . i knew that those children knew in that . moment that they mattered that they . mattered and so i encourage you it's . exciting to be able to write a check . it's even more exciting to be able to . touch one life . to be able to do that for one person . it's like cynthia was saying when you . can do that for one person when you can . do that you will know that your life has . meaning and i will tell you when i left . that place my friend gail and i were . there and we're all boohoo and we're . like boom with the children oh my gosh . and gail was saying what is it what is . it we're so full as gail said to me she . said you know as big as your show is as . big as your show is what happened in . that room seemed bigger . what happened in that room sing bigger . and that is true that is true for me who . has this big life in a television show . and i'm telling you for everybody here . extending yourself beyond your world . your kids your family your stuff and . reaching out to somebody who is not like . you somebody who is like you who is . indeed if you are feeling depressed or . you are feeling down or you're feeling . like things aren't going the way you . want them to go in your life the way you . turn that around is to reach outside of . yourself to somebody else reach outside . of yourself to somebody else it will . change you . it will change you . so it is my intention . my intention . to fulfill the dream of the creator . it is my intention . to live to the highest calling and be . pressed to the mark of the highest . calling that i have come to do . and when you can ask the creator . ask that which made you you . what is your dream for me . i guarantee you instead of you trying to . define the dream what is your dream for . me . if you're able to lean . into the dream . that the universe and all the forces of . of of of light and love and power and . grace by all the names that we call god . has for you . nobody can touch you . nobody can touch you . so . you\n",
